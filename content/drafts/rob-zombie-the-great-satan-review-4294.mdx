Five years is a long time to wait. *The Lunar Injection Kool Aid Eclipse Conspiracy* had moments but never felt fully locked in — too sprawling, too willing to wander. *The Great Satan* does not wander. Rob Zombie&#8217;s eighth solo record is a focused, 38-minute chainsaw rip through the same haunted drive-in territory he built his name on, and for the first time in over a decade, the machine feels fully operational. Returning guitarist Mike Riggs — missing since *The Sinister Urge* — and bassist Blasko — absent since *Educated Horses* — are not minor footnotes. They are the spine. Producer Chris &#8220;Zeuss&#8221; Harris keeps the industrial horror-metal architecture intact without letting it calcify into self-parody. If you bounced off the last few Zombie records, *The Great Satan* is the one that asks you to come back.

## What You Are Getting Into

Fifteen tracks. Punishing riffs. Soundbites grafted to electro-pulse grooves. The bones of this record are the same bones that built *Hellbilly Deluxe* and *Sinister Urge* — the DNA is not in question. What *The Great Satan* adds is coherence. Every element earns its place. The interludes (&#8220;Who Am I?,&#8221; &#8220;Welcome to the Electric Age,&#8221; closer &#8220;Grave Discontent&#8221;) function as genuine scene breaks rather than runtime padding. The record was built to be sequenced in this order, and it shows. You will want to [read our initial news drop on the release](https://metal-mantra.com/metal-hard-rock-news-february-27-2026/) if you need context on where this fits in Zombie&#8217;s current moment — but the short version is this: he came back ready to work.

## Track Highlights

**&#8220;F.T.W. 84&#8221;** opens the record exactly the way an opener should: no setup, no warm-up, just chainsaw guitars firing into a grid of industrial pulse. The riff is immediate and mean. Riggs&#8217;s tone here alone justifies the reunion. This is what the pre-singles promised, delivered without hesitation.

**&#8220;Tarantula&#8221;** is the record&#8217;s best argument that Zombie has not lost his instinct for groove. Go-go rhythms, Blasko&#8217;s bass anchoring the low end with something close to swagger, Zombie&#8217;s vocal cut at just the right angle between snarl and theatrics. It sounds like the early records without being a copy of them. That is harder to pull off than it looks.

**&#8220;Unclean Animals&#8221;** is where the album earns its late-game respect. A slow, doomy stomp through dissonant guitar work and a tonal architecture that leans gothic and almost progressive by Zombie&#8217;s standards — this is the track that signals he is not just running back his greatest hits. The orchestral undercurrent is deliberate and unsettling. It is the track most likely to sound different on the fifth listen than it did on the first.

Credit where it is due to **&#8220;Heathen Days&#8221;** and **&#8220;Punks and Demons&#8221;** as well — both of which appeared as pre-release singles and held up against the full album context. &#8220;Heathen Days&#8221; in particular, with its fuel-injected tempo and Riggs&#8217;s mammoth string bends, is the kind of single that reminds you why this band still matters. Blabbermouth gave the record an 8.5. Kerrang! gave it 4/5. Pitchfork gave it a 5.4, which, as ever with Pitchfork on Zombie, tells you more about Pitchfork than the album.

The one soft spot: &#8220;Out of Sight&#8221; and &#8220;Revolution Motherfuckers&#8221; are competent but skippable in the context of what surrounds them. They are not bad songs. They are average Zombie songs, which in the frame of a 15-track record that is otherwise firing on all cylinders, makes them stick out as the two moments where the accelerator eases up. Neither sinks the record. If you want a comparison point for how Zombie handles a full-length that holds its weight, check our review of [Testament&#8217;s *Para Bellum*](https://metal-mantra.com/testament-para-bellum-album-review/) — a different subgenre, similar energy of a veteran band refusing to coast.

## The Verdict

**Worth Your Time.** *The Great Satan* is the Rob Zombie record that earns back whatever goodwill the mid-period albums spent. Riggs and Blasko back in the lineup is not nostalgic stunt casting — it changes the sound in ways that matter. The record is tight, theatrical, and confident in a way Zombie&#8217;s work has not been since *Hellbilly Deluxe 2*. At 38 minutes, it does not overstay. You get what you came for and it leaves before the welcome wears out.

**Score: 8/10**
