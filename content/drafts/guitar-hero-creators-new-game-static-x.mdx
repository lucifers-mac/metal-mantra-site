The genre that turned plastic guitars into living room staples is getting another shot. RedOctane — the studio behind the original *Guitar Hero* franchise — has unveiled *Stage Tour*, a new guitar-centered rhythm game built by several veterans who helped create *Guitar Hero* from the ground up. The reveal trailer dropped recently, and it is soundtracked by Static-X's "Terminator Oscillator." That is not a coincidence. That is a statement.

*Stage Tour* is targeting a fall 2026 release, with a beta planned for the summer months. If you want in early, that is your window.

## RedOctane Is Back, And They Mean It

RedOctane was the developer and publisher that originally brought *Guitar Hero* to the world back in 2005. The franchise went on to become one of the highest-grossing music game series in history before Activision ran it into the ground with annual oversaturation and the ill-fated *Guitar Hero Live* reboot. The brand went quiet after 2015.

Now the team that built the original is regrouping. *Stage Tour* is being developed by original *Guitar Hero* creators operating under RedOctane, and they are not starting from scratch — they have real infrastructure behind them. Kramer-Gibson is already confirmed as a partner on the new guitar peripheral. That is not a prototype-stage announcement. That means a production-ready controller is in development alongside the game, which is the only way a rhythm game of this type has a legitimate shot at working.

For context, RedOctane had previously been developing a guitar controller built for compatibility with existing titles like *Fortnite Festival*, *Rock Band*, and the PC fan-driven *Clone Hero*. That work was not wasted. It fed directly into the foundation for *Stage Tour*.

## Static-X Provides The Soundtrack To A New Era

The choice to open with "Terminator Oscillator" is sharp. Static-X does not traffic in nostalgia bait. The track is aggressive, mechanical, and propulsive — exactly the kind of music that works when you are trying to communicate that something hard is coming back to life.

Static-X was founded in Los Angeles in 1994 by the late Wayne Static, and the band built its identity on a collision of industrial metal and nu-metal that still holds up. Their 1999 debut *Wisconsin Death Trip* went platinum in the U.S. and cemented their place in the genre. "Terminator Oscillator" captures that same relentless forward momentum. Pairing it with a reveal trailer for a guitar game revival is a choice that respects both the band and the audience.

No official licensed tracklist has been announced for *Stage Tour* yet. The trailer does not confirm Static-X as a playable artist — it uses "Terminator Oscillator" as a mood piece. But for heavy music fans who have been waiting for a rhythm game that does not pander, this is an encouraging signal.

If you are not already familiar with Static-X's catalog, this is a good time to get acquainted. The band remains active, currently touring with Dope, with dates running through summer 2026 including appearances at Welcome To Rockville and Sonic Temple. You can grab their music on vinyl and CD — *Wisconsin Death Trip* on vinyl is [available on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002LJI?tag=metalmantra-20) and worth having in your collection.

## Why This Matters For Heavy Music Fans

*Guitar Hero* at its peak was one of the few mainstream touchpoints where metal and hard rock commanded the room. Buckethead, Dragonforce, Killswitch Engage, Slayer — the franchise put those songs in front of millions of people who might never have found them otherwise. The genre was not perfect, but it was a pipeline.

*Stage Tour* is being positioned as that pipeline rebuilt. With the original creative minds behind the wheel and a hardware partner like Kramer-Gibson confirmed before the game even launches, this is not vaporware. The fall 2026 target is credible, and the summer beta means the community will have input before it ships.

For anyone who spent hours on *Guitar Hero II* or *Guitar Hero: Metallica*, this is worth tracking. And for anyone who never understood what the fuss was about — watch the trailer with "Terminator Oscillator" cranked and reconsider.

Metal Mantra has been covering the intersection of heavy music and gaming since the early days of the *Guitar Hero* era.
