Thirteen years is a long time to wait. But Tomahawk has never operated on anyone else’s timeline.

Mike Patton’s most unsettling and singular band is back — and they have announced a U.S. summer tour running from July 18 through August 15, 2026. The run is called “A Huge Waste of Your Time and Money,” which tells you everything you need to know about how seriously they take themselves. That is to say: not at all, and completely, simultaneously. The Melvins will support on every date.

This is not a nostalgia cash-grab. Tomahawk does not do nostalgia. What it is — and what it should be treated as — is a rare chance to see one of the most genuinely strange and uncompromising bands in heavy music do what they do in a room with you.

## The Context: Why This Matters

Tomahawk last toured in 2013 behind *Oddfellows*, their third record and arguably their most accessible — which still means it was weirder than 90 percent of what anyone else was making. Then in 2021, they quietly dropped *Tonic Immobility*, a record that arrived without ceremony and without a supporting tour, swallowed whole by the pandemic and the general collapse of the live music ecosystem. That album deserved better. It was dense, abrasive, and fully alive — a band that hadn’t lost a step despite years of dormancy.

So in a real sense, this tour is five years overdue. *Tonic Immobility* never got its moment on stage. Whether this run functions as belated support for that record or just a chance for the band to exist in live form again is almost beside the point. The audience that shows up will be getting the full spectrum — five albums worth of material from a catalog that spans tribal percussion, noise rock, jazz-adjacent dissonance, and pure heavy music hostility.

The band has been direct about expectations. In a statement posted to their social channels, they addressed the fan speculation head-on: no new music is planned, no meet and greets, no song requests. They are not adding cities to the run. They are not softening the edges for a wider audience. This is Tomahawk on their own terms — the only way they have ever operated.

## The Lineup and What It Signals

The lineup is: Mike Patton on vocals, Duane Denison on guitar, John Stanier on drums, and Trevor Dunn — who came aboard for *Oddfellows* in 2013 — holding down bass. That is a lineup stacked with musicians who have never been content to just fill a role. Stanier’s drumming has its own gravitational pull. Denison’s guitar work sits somewhere between avant-garde and hard rock in a way that nobody else has managed to replicate. Dunn brings a jazz-informed low-end that keeps the whole thing from collapsing into straightforward metal.

And then there is Patton. Whatever is happening in his broader career — and [the ongoing uncertainty around Faith No More](https://metal-mantra.com/mike-patton-hints-at-quiet-closure-for-faith-no-more/) has been its own conversation — Tomahawk has always been the project where he seems most relaxed in the darkness. There is no pressure to be a frontman here in the conventional sense. He can be unsettling, minimal, theatrical, or feral depending on what the song demands. That range is what makes Tomahawk live an experience that does not translate neatly to a highlight reel.

The choice of the Melvins as support is exactly right. These are not two bands thrown together for demographic overlap. They are longtime Ipecac labelmates with a shared DNA — experimental, difficult, unbothered by mainstream accessibility. A Tomahawk and Melvins bill in 2026 is a two-hour argument for why heavy music does not need to compromise to be essential.

## What Fans Should Actually Expect

Do not go expecting a polished arena-rock production. Tomahawk shows have always been about intensity in contained spaces — and this run is hitting mid-size venues across the country. Brooklyn Steel. The Riviera. First Avenue. The Warfield. These are rooms where the music can get physical, where there is nowhere to hide from what the band is doing.

Expect material from across the catalog. The self-titled debut from 2001 holds up as one of the most genuinely weird rock records of that era. *Mit Gas* pushed the dissonance further. *Anonymous* — the album built around Native American traditional music — remains one of the most unusual and polarizing records Patton has ever put his name on. *Oddfellows* and *Tonic Immobility* round out a catalog that rewards listeners who pay attention.

No new music is coming. The band said so plainly, without apology. That is fine. The existing catalog is deep enough that a set list drawn from all five records would be more than most bands could offer in a lifetime. And frankly, Tomahawk announcing a reunion tour while also teasing new material would feel like a different, lesser band. The honesty here is consistent with who they are.

## The Bigger Picture

This tour matters for reasons that go beyond Tomahawk specifically. The past few years have seen the experimental end of heavy music contract. The easy money is in legacy acts playing nostalgia sets, in polished productions that feel safe. Tomahawk stepping back into the live space — for a limited run, on their terms, with no pretense — is a reminder that there is still an audience for music that does not ask permission.

For anyone tracking what has been happening in the broader Patton universe, this is also the most active he has appeared in the live space in some time. Keep watching. For now, this run is the event worth circling on the calendar.

Tickets for “A Huge Waste of Your Time and Money” are on sale now. The tour runs July 18 through August 15. For the full rundown on recent heavy music news, [check the latest Metal Mantra news roundup](https://metal-mantra.com/metal-hard-rock-news-february-23-2026/).
