2K Sports has revealed the full soundtrack for *WWE 2K26*, and whoever curated this list has taste. The game launches worldwide on March 13, with Premium Edition buyers getting early access starting March 6. The soundtrack spans heavy rock, metal, and alternative with a selection that reads more like a festival lineup than a typical sports game playlist.

Linkin Park. Turnstile. Powerman 5000. Bad Omens. Better Lovers. Gatecreeper. This is not background filler.

## The Full WWE 2K26 Soundtrack

Here is everything confirmed for the game:

- **Turnstile** — "Dull"
- **Linkin Park** — "Two Faced"
- **Hanumankind ft. Denzel Curry** — "Reckless"
- **Jennie** — "ExtraL"
- **Transplants** — "Diamonds and Guns"
- **Powerman 5000** — "When Worlds Collide"
- **Bad Omens x ERRA** — "Anything > Human"
- **Ecca Vandal** — "Cruising To Self Soothe"
- **The Warning** — "Que Mas Quieres"
- **Andrew W.K.** — "Party Hard"
- **The Paradox ft. Travis Barker** — "Bender"
- **Better Lovers** — "Lie Between The Lines"
- **Gatecreeper** — "The Black Curtain"
- **Viagra Boys** — "Man Made Of Meat"
- **Ho99o9** — "Upside Down"
- **The Mistakes** — "Heathens"

Sixteen tracks. A healthy chunk of them are legitimately heavy. That is a strong showing for a mainstream sports title.

## Why This Soundtrack Works

Sports games have long used their soundtracks as cultural signaling. What they play tells you who they think is buying the game and who they want buying the game. For *WWE 2K26*, the signal is clear: the audience that grew up on Linkin Park and Powerman 5000 in the late '90s and early 2000s is now in their 30s and 40s, and they still watch wrestling.

Turnstile's "Dull" is from *Glow On*, an album that crossed hardcore into the mainstream without softening either. It is an aggressive opener for any playlist. Pairing it alongside Linkin Park's "Two Faced" — from the band's *From Zero* album with Emily Armstrong on vocals — gives the soundtrack an interesting push-pull between the underground and the arena.

Powerman 5000's "When Worlds Collide" is a flat-out classic. That track belongs in a *WWE* game. Spider One has been making the case for industrial metal in pop culture since 1999, and this is one of the most recognizable heavy rock songs of that era. If you need the *Whore of the Internet* album in your collection, [it is available on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00000J3I5?tag=metalmantra-20).

## The Metal Picks Worth Highlighting

**Bad Omens x ERRA — "Anything > Human"**: A collaboration that makes sense. Bad Omens has been one of the most commercially successful metalcore-adjacent acts of the past several years, and ERRA brings a technical edge that elevates the pairing. This will reach ears that have never heard ERRA before.

**Better Lovers — "Lie Between The Lines"**: Better Lovers is the metalcore supergroup featuring Greg Puciato of Dillinger Escape Plan, Josh Travis of Glass Cloud, and members of Every Time I Die. Their inclusion in a mainstream sports title is a signal of how much ground that band has covered in a short time.

**Gatecreeper — "The Black Curtain"**: This is the most unexpected entry on the list, and the most significant for heavy music fans. Gatecreeper plays death metal — not radio-friendly, not diluted, not particularly commercial. Their appearance on a major video game soundtrack means 2K is either taking creative risks or someone in the music licensing department is a genuine fan. Either way, it is a win.

**Ho99o9 — "Upside Down"**: Ho99o9 exists at the intersection of punk, metal, and hip-hop, and they have been grinding the underground circuit for years. Another name that earns its spot.

## What This Means For The Heavy Music Scene

Sports game soundtracks move units. When "When Worlds Collide" showed up in pop culture touchpoints in the early 2000s, it extended Powerman 5000's reach well beyond radio. The same dynamic applies here. Gatecreeper, Better Lovers, and Ho99o9 all stand to gain new listeners from *WWE 2K26* appearing on their Spotify profiles and in their search results.

For *WWE 2K26* specifically, the soundtrack reinforces what the game's marketing has already been signaling: this edition is leaning into its core audience rather than chasing casual fans. The *WWE* fanbase and the heavy music audience have always had significant overlap — the Monday Night Wars era ran on Marilyn Manson and Jim Johnston themes built from metal DNA. This soundtrack acknowledges that relationship directly.

*WWE 2K26* releases globally on March 13. Premium Edition access begins March 6. The game is available for preorder now on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC — [grab it through Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CWQGSDQY?tag=metalmantra-20) and get it on launch day.
