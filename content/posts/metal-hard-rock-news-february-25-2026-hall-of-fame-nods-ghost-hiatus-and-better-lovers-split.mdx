Midweek and the news cycle is swinging heavy. Iron Maiden is all over this one — Rock Hall nomination and a documentary in the same breath. A major vocalist exit, a Ghost pause nobody&#8217;s surprised by, and AI-generated garbage getting publicly torched. Here&#8217;s what actually matters today.

## Iron Maiden and Black Crowes Among 2026 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Nominees

The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame dropped its 2026 nominee list today, and Iron Maiden is finally on it. Seventeen artists total — including the Black Crowes, Oasis, Joy Division/New Order, Billy Idol, and a handful of pop names that&#8217;ll start arguments in every comment section on the internet. Ten of the nominees are first-timers. Maiden&#8217;s inclusion is long overdue for a band that&#8217;s been filling stadiums globally for five decades, and their 50th anniversary tour is still actively rolling. Fan voting is open now, inductees get announced in April, and the ceremony hits sometime this fall. If Maiden doesn&#8217;t get in this year after a Hall of Fame nomination, a documentary, and a world tour all running simultaneously, the institution has lost the plot entirely.

## Iron Maiden&#8217;s &#8216;Burning Ambition&#8217; Documentary Hitting Theaters May 7

Speaking of Maiden — their five-decade story is getting a proper theatrical release. *Iron Maiden: Burning Ambition*, directed by Malcolm Venville, lands in cinemas May 7 for a limited run, with tickets going on sale March 18. The film features current and archival interviews with the band plus outside voices like Lars Ulrich, Chuck D, and actor Javier Bardem. Between this, the ongoing Run for Your Lives tour, and the newly announced EddFest two-day event at Knebworth this July — complete with an Eddie-themed museum and fairground rides — Maiden&#8217;s 50th year is turning into a full-scale campaign. Mark March 18 for tickets. Limited theatrical runs don&#8217;t stick around.

## Better Lovers Part Ways With Greg Puciato

Better Lovers — the band that rose from the wreckage of Every Time I Die — announced they&#8217;re parting ways with vocalist Greg Puciato. The remaining four (Jordan Buckley, Will Putney, Stephen Micciche, Clayton Holyoak) say they&#8217;re finishing a new album and actively searching for a new singer. Puciato responded on Instagram with zero drama: &#8220;No bad blood. Everyone&#8217;s cool. Don&#8217;t speculate. Long live the frog.&#8221; He&#8217;s already locked into Jerry Cantrell&#8217;s live band and just reactivated The Black Queen for spring shows, so he&#8217;s not exactly sitting around. The split comes barely two years after their debut album *Highly Irresponsible*, which makes this a short but productive chapter. The real question now is whether Better Lovers can find a voice that matches what Puciato brought — or if this becomes a fundamentally different band.

## Tobias Forge Says Ghost Will Go on Hiatus After the Skeletour

Tobias Forge confirmed what a lot of fans have been sensing — Ghost has nothing planned beyond the current Skeletá tour cycle. In an interview on Full Metal Jackie&#8217;s radio show, Forge was unusually candid about burnout after 15 years of building Ghost from the ground up. He compared his role to being a house builder who handles everything from permits to tiling, and admitted he&#8217;s run out of materials. He&#8217;s got two film projects in development and already recorded an album with a different project before this tour started, so he&#8217;s not disappearing. But for Ghost specifically, this is the first real pause since *Opus Eponymous*. The rare case where a frontman at the peak of momentum says &#8220;I&#8217;m actually fine if I lose it&#8221; — and sounds like he means it.

## Philip Anselmo Shuts Down AI-Generated Health Rumors

Pantera frontman Philip Anselmo went on social media Tuesday to kill a round of fake AI-generated posts claiming he was battling blood cancer. His response was direct — it&#8217;s all bull. The whole thing was fabricated by AI content farms, and Anselmo made sure fans heard it from him before the rumor machine could run any further. This is becoming a recurring and genuinely dangerous problem across the music world as AI-generated misinformation gets more convincing and spreads faster than corrections can travel. If you saw those posts circulating, they were fake. Anselmo is fine. Pantera is still active. Don&#8217;t share garbage you can&#8217;t verify.

## Voivod&#8217;s Denis &#8220;Snake&#8221; Bélanger&#8217;s Wife Battling Stage 4 Cancer — GoFundMe Launched

Voivod have reached out to their fanbase for support after revealing that Christine McDonald, partner of frontman Denis &#8220;Snake&#8221; Bélanger, was diagnosed with Stage 4 colorectal cancer last October. The cancer has metastasized to her liver, ovary, and abdominal wall. Treatment is ongoing and showing some positive signs, but it&#8217;s intensive — daily injections, chemotherapy, and constant hospital visits. The financial strain has been severe, impacting both McDonald&#8217;s ability to work and Bélanger&#8217;s capacity to maintain his commitments with the band. A GoFundMe has been set up to help with medical costs and living expenses. If Voivod&#8217;s music has meant something to you over the last four decades, this is one of those moments where showing up matters more than sharing a post.

## Tom Morello Postpones Solo Tour to Join Bruce Springsteen on the Road

Tom Morello has shelved his planned spring solo tour to hit the road with Bruce Springsteen instead. No elaborate explanation — when The Boss calls, you take the gig. Morello&#8217;s been a recurring presence in Springsteen&#8217;s live setup and the chemistry is well documented at this point. For fans who had tickets to the solo dates, the postponement stings, but the tradeoff is Morello playing to massive rooms with one of rock&#8217;s greatest live performers. Expect rescheduled solo dates once the Springsteen commitment wraps.
