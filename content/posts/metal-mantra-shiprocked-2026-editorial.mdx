**We’re heading back to the open ocean for six days of unfiltered heavy music chaos—and this time, I’m bringing Metal Mantra with me.** We’ll keep updates rolling in our [ShipRocked coverage](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/shiprocked/).

In two days, I’m flying to Miami. Five days from now, I’ll be boarding the Carnival Horizon for [Shiprocked 2026](https://www.shiprocked.com). This will be my third Shiprocked (Triple Threat status, for those keeping track), but it’s my first time covering it as Metal Mantra. The first two times, I was just another metalhead on the ship. This year? I’m bringing you all with me.

## Why Shiprocked Hits Different

Land-based festivals are incredible, but they’re temporary. You show up, catch your favorite bands, and everyone scatters. You’re back to real life by Monday.

Shiprocked doesn’t work like that. When you board the Carnival Horizon on January 22nd, you’re entering a completely self-contained metal universe for six days. The bands aren’t jetting off to the next city after their set. They’re wandering the pool deck, at the bars, standing in line for the buffet wondering why cruise ship bacon always tastes the same.

I’ve done this twice before, and those moments are what stick with me. I watched Anthrax’s Joey Belladonna walk past me in board shorts holding an ice cream cone. I saw members of The Struts and Atreyu singing Bohemian Rhapsody and Whitney Houston’s I Wanna Dance with Somebody (respectively) in the piano bar at 2 AM. These aren’t curated meet-and-greets—this is just what happens when you put everyone in the same space for six days. The walls between “band” and “fan” dissolve.

## The 2026 Lineup: Heavier, Broader, Undeniable

This year’s [Shiprocked lineup](https://metal-mantra.com/shiprocked-2026-cruise-details-lineup) actually reflects where heavy music is right now. You’ve got scene veterans like Halestorm and Suicidal Tendencies sharing the bill with modern heavy hitters like Knocked Loose and Motionless In White. There’s Wage War, AWOLNATION, [Avatar](https://metal-mantra.com/avatar-spring-2026-tour/), Kittie making their triumphant return, Starset (first time back since 2018), and Sleep Theory. It’s not trying to stick to one lane, and that’s a good thing.

Knocked Loose on a boat is going to be absolute chaos, and I mean that as a compliment. If you’ve seen them live on land, you know what kind of energy they bring—*suffocating*, relentless, and completely unhinged. Now imagine that in a room where nobody can leave. It’s going to be beautiful mayhem.

Halestorm is getting a special performance slot in Nassau. Motionless In White knows how to work a crowd, and seeing them perform multiple times over six days means you get to experience different sides of what they bring.

And then there’s the depth: From Ashes to New, ’68, Dead Poet Society, The Funeral Portrait, and a whole wave of emerging acts that represent where heavy music is headed. If you’ve been sleeping on any of these bands, Shiprocked is your wake-up call.

## What I’m Bringing Back

The first two times I went to Shiprocked, I went as a fan. This year, I’m going as Metal Mantra—to bring this experience to people who can’t be there and tell the stories that deserve to be told.

**The performances.** Not just the mainstage sets. Shiprocked has smaller showcases and acoustic performances scattered throughout the week—watching a metal frontman strip back their biggest songs in front of 100 people is something you can’t replicate anywhere else. This year, I’m documenting those moments.

**The conversations.** My first two Shiprocked experiences, I had incredible random conversations with band members—casual, unguarded moments you’d never get in a traditional press setting. Now that I’m going as Metal Mantra, I’m turning some of those organic moments into actual interviews. There’s something about being on a ship with no distractions that changes the quality of conversations. People are more open, more willing to go deep.

**The community.** By day three, you’re recognizing faces everywhere, sharing tables at dinner, comparing notes on which sets destroyed you the hardest. This year, I’m documenting it and helping people who couldn’t be there feel like they’re part of it too.

**The unexpected moments.** Impromptu jam sessions. Surprise guest appearances. Random chaos that happens when you put thousands of metalheads on a ship with nowhere else to be. I’ve learned you can’t plan for those moments—but you can be ready to capture them.

## What to Expect

Expect daily updates while we’re at sea (when the ship’s Wi-Fi cooperates). Expect photo galleries, video clips, and real-time reactions. Expect interviews with as many bands as I can corner between sets and pool parties. Expect honest reviews of the performances and the experience.

When I get back, you’re getting the deep dive. The full breakdown of every set, every surprise, every moment that made Shiprocked 2026 worth the trip. I’m bringing back stories you won’t find anywhere else, because I’ll be living it alongside everyone else on that ship.

## Why This Matters

Shiprocked is where the metal community shows up. Not the gatekeepers, not the elitists—just fans, bands, and industry folks who are all there to celebrate heavy music in its rawest, most communal form.

In an era where music scenes are splintered across a thousand subgenres and online echo chambers, Shiprocked is a reminder that we’re all still part of the same thing. The kid who’s only into deathcore is standing next to the 50-year-old thrash purist, and they’re both losing their minds to the same breakdown. That unity matters.

And on a practical level, Shiprocked is where connections happen. Festival promoters, label reps, band managers, PR contacts—they’re all on this ship, and they’re all more accessible than they’d ever be on land. This year, every connection made feeds back into making Metal Mantra better.

## Final Thoughts

In two days, I’m getting on a plane to Miami. Then I’m boarding the Carnival Horizon with thousands of metalheads and some of the best heavy bands in the world.

This is my third Shiprocked, but it’s my first as Metal Mantra. The [first two times](https://metal-mantra.com/shiprocked-2025-review-metal-festival-chaos-at-sea) taught me what this experience is really about. This time, I’m bringing that knowledge—and all of you—along for the ride.

If you’ve been following Metal Mantra since we launched in late November, thank you. This is exactly the kind of coverage I wanted to bring you. If you’re new here, welcome aboard. You picked a hell of a week to start paying attention.

I’ll see you on the other side. Stay tuned for updates, and when I get back, we’re going deep.

🤘 Let’s do this.
