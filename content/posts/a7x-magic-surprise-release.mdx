[**Avenged Sevenfold**](https://www.avengedsevenfold.com/news/-magic-out-now) have pulled another signature left hook, surprise-dropping a brand-new song titled **“Magic”** — a collaborative track created for **Call of Duty: Black Ops 7** and released alongside the game’s Season 01 launch content. Without warning, the band unleashed the track across streaming platforms and a fully immersive 360° visual experience, sending fans scrambling for headphones and dissecting clues the way only the A7X community can. More reviews: [Review hub](https://metal-mantra.com/review/).

This marks the band’s first new music since their 2023 experimental record *Life Is but a Dream…*, and while **“Magic”** definitely inherits some of that album’s mind-warping DNA, it pushes into a different, more aggressive direction tailored for the Cold War–themed chaos of **Black Ops 7**. For fans wondering what the next phase of A7X might sound like, this track is a loud, glitchy clue.
## “Magic” Track Review: Cyber-Psychedelic Heavy Metal from Avenged Sevenfold

**“Magic”** kicks off with a sharp digital snarl — glitchy electronics, distorted vocal layers, and a creeping sense of unease that fits directly into the *Black Ops* universe. Then the real hit comes: a **crushing, palm-muted groove** that drops like a bunker buster. Synyster Gates’ guitar tone is dense and warped, like it has been routed through a malfunctioning AI, and the main riff swings between industrial chug, progressive twists, and psychedelic math-metal freak-outs.
### M. Shadows’ Vocal Performance

**M. Shadows** leans heavily into his modern vocal palette — half-crooned, half-snarled, processed but still expressive. The chorus slips into a surreal, almost hypnotic melody, layered with harmonies that feel both eerie and triumphant. It’s catchy but unsettling, the musical equivalent of staring down the barrel of a mind-control experiment, which fits the **Call of Duty: Black Ops 7** vibe perfectly.
### Rhythm Section & Production

Behind the chaos, **Brooks Wackerman** drives the track with explosive, stuttering drum patterns that feel almost programmed, blurring the line between organic thrash energy and cinematic battlefield tension. **Johnny Christ** locks in with a thick, mechanical bass pulse that keeps the song grounded while the guitars and electronics spiral outward.

Production-wise, **“Magic”** sits somewhere between the futuristic glitch-metal of “Game Over,” the multi-layered psychedelic weirdness of “Cosmic,” and the explosive, riff-driven swagger of the *Hail to the King* era. It’s weird, heavy, and unmistakably Avenged Sevenfold.
## Avenged Sevenfold & Call of Duty: A Long-Running Alliance

**Avenged Sevenfold** and **Call of Duty** have been creatively intertwined for over a decade. From earlier soundtrack placements to in-game appearances, the partnership has become a recurring crossover moment for both communities. With **“Magic”**, the band pushes that relationship further by crafting a track that mirrors the themes of **Black Ops 7**:

Cold War paranoia and psychological warfare
Digital espionage and unseen manipulation
High-tension, no-safe-space battlefield energy
Blurring the line between reality and experiment

The lyrics and atmosphere feel perfectly aligned with *Black Ops*’ trademark narrative style — cryptic, conspiratorial, and a little unhinged. It plays like a soundtrack to mind games and double crosses, rather than a generic “metal song for a video game.”
## Is “Magic” a One-Off or the Start of a New A7X Era?

The surprise release of **“Magic”** has fans speculating about whether this track is a standalone single or an early signal of where Avenged Sevenfold might be heading next. The band has a long history of playing by their own rules — dropping teasers, cryptic visuals, and unconventional rollouts instead of traditional album cycles.

Releasing a high-profile collaboration track like this, outside of a typical album announcement, hints that A7X could be experimenting with more **singles, soundtracks, and multimedia projects** around whatever they have planned for 2026 and beyond. Historically, when Avenged Sevenfold start releasing puzzle-piece songs, more pieces tend to follow.
## Final Thoughts: “Magic” as a Statement Track

Ultimately, **“Magic”** is a bold, chaotic, immersive slab of modern **Avenged Sevenfold**. It blends their most experimental instincts with a return to heavy, riff-driven aggression, wrapped in a cinematic shell that fits the **Call of Duty: Black Ops 7** universe perfectly.

It’s dark, glitchy, and psychedelic. It feels designed to live in your headphones and inside the game at the same time. For longtime A7X fans, it delivers the kind of high-concept, high-drama metal they’ve come to expect. For Black Ops players, it’s the kind of track that makes late-night sessions feel even more intense.

If this is the tone of what’s coming next from Avenged Sevenfold, 2026 might get very loud, very weird, and very fun.
