### Metal & Hard Rock News – February 6, 2026: Dickinson&#8217;s Solo Return, Global Tour Announcements, and Health-First Decisions

The metal world is firing on all cylinders as February rolls forward, delivering a concentrated burst of tour announcements spanning three continents, studio updates from iconic frontmen, and critical health decisions from veteran performers. From Bruce Dickinson&#8217;s analog recording sessions with Sepultura members at Dave Grohl&#8217;s legendary Studio 606 to a stacked summer metalcore package tearing through the United States, today&#8217;s developments prove the heavy music ecosystem remains as active and globe-spanning as ever, with established legends and rising forces alike commanding attention across multiple territories and subgenres. Catch more in the [latest Rundown](https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/).

 **Bruce Dickinson** is currently deep in the tracking process for his next solo album at Dave Grohl&#8217;s renowned Studio 606, working alongside members of Sepultura and capturing performances live in the room using traditional analog methods that prioritize organic energy over digital precision. Once the recording wraps, the Iron Maiden vocalist will rejoin his legendary band for the massive 2026 &#8220;Run For Your Lives&#8221; tour, which will see the metal institution storming through Europe and the Americas with what promises to be one of the year&#8217;s most ambitious heavy music productions.

 **Fear Factory** has confirmed a May 2026 tour across Australia and New Zealand, finally bringing their mechanized, groove-laden industrial metal assault to the Southern Hemisphere with confirmed stops in Perth, Adelaide, and additional cities throughout both countries. This marks a significant moment for the revitalized outfit, as their punishing blend of mechanical precision and crushing heaviness will reach fans who have waited years for the band to make the journey Down Under, cementing Fear Factory&#8217;s commitment to global touring despite past internal turbulence.

 **Mastodon** just unveiled a comprehensive European tour scheduled for summer 2026, with rising British metalcore act Loathe confirmed as direct support across multiple countries throughout the run. The Atlanta sludge metal titans will flex their progressive muscle and technical prowess across the continent, delivering their signature blend of complex arrangements and crushing riffs to audiences from Scandinavia to Southern Europe in what stands as one of the season&#8217;s most anticipated heavy music pairings.

 **Motionless In White** dropped a bombshell summer tour announcement featuring a stacked bill that includes deathcore powerhouse Lorna Shore, metalcore mainstays Fit For A King, and rising UK post-hardcore outfit Static Dress, creating what may be the most potent metalcore package of the 2026 touring season. The multi-city United States run will showcase the full spectrum of modern heavy music, from theatrical gothic metal to technical brutality, giving fans across the country a comprehensive look at the current state of metalcore&#8217;s evolution and commercial reach,

 **Poison the Well** is making the journey to Australia this June, bringing their influential blend of metallic hardcore and emotional intensity to the continent with support from local act Haywire on select dates. The Florida legends, who helped define the intersection of hardcore aggression and melodic sensibility in the early 2000s, will fly the flag for American metalcore internationally, proving their continued relevance and drawing power nearly three decades into their career.

 **Maul** announced a headlining United States tour scheduled for March 2026, bringing their punishing death metal barrage to cities spanning from Wisconsin through Texas and hitting multiple regions in between. The North Dakota death metal outfit continues building momentum behind their crushing riff-driven approach, demonstrating that underground extreme metal still commands dedicated audiences willing to pack venues for uncompromising brutality delivered with technical precision and old-school intensity.

 **New Music Releases** flooded the zone over the past 48 hours, with Transilvania unleashing &#8220;Set The Tombs On Fire&#8221; alongside accompanying visual content, while Cyclone, Tailgunner, and Sister Sin also dropped fresh singles and music videos that span multiple subgenres from traditional heavy metal to modern aggression. This simultaneous release barrage demonstrates the constant content flow that defines contemporary metal culture, where established acts and emerging forces alike maintain visibility through regular single drops and visual media that keep fans engaged between album cycles and tour announcements.

 **Blaze Bayley** made the difficult but necessary decision to permanently eliminate traditional meet-and-greet sessions from his touring schedule, prioritizing his long-term health and recovery following a serious cardiac event that required immediate medical intervention. The former Iron Maiden vocalist will continue performing live shows and connecting with audiences through his music, but the physical and time demands of post-show autograph sessions and extended fan interactions have been removed from his professional obligations, reflecting a growing awareness among aging metal musicians about sustainable career management and the importance of health maintenance over fan service expectations.
