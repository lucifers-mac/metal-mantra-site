## **Avenged Sevenfold & Good Charlotte Announce Massive Summer 2026 North American Tour**

Two powerhouse bands from different corners of heavy music are teaming up for one of 2026’s biggest rock events. **Avenged Sevenfold** and **Good Charlotte** have [officially announced](https://www.avengedsevenfold.com/news/a7x-x-good-charlotte-2026-tour) a **co-headline Summer 2026 North American Tour**, marking a rare crossover between modern metal and pop-punk that is already generating huge excitement across the scene. Tickets and tour roundups live on our [Tours & Tickets hub](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/).

The tour will hit major amphitheaters, arenas, and outdoor venues across the U.S. and Canada beginning in early June and running well into August. This marks Avenged Sevenfold’s first major extended run since supporting their critically acclaimed album *Life Is But a Dream…*, while Good Charlotte returns to the national spotlight with fresh momentum and longstanding fan demand.

## **A Bold Pairing: Metal Meets Pop-Punk**

Though Avenged Sevenfold and Good Charlotte come from different sonic backgrounds, both bands dominated the 2000s alternative scene and built multi-generational followings. Fans online are already calling this one of the most unexpected — and exciting — tour pairings of the last decade.

Avenged Sevenfold continue to push creative boundaries with experimental production, immersive live shows, and setlists that span their full career. Good Charlotte’s return brings anthems like “The Anthem,” “Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous,” and “I Just Wanna Live” back to major stages, tapping into intense nostalgia alongside new material.

## **Tour Dates**

The full list of dates is being shared across participating outlets, with stops confirmed in major markets including Denver, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Toronto, Dallas, and more. A complete date list is expected with the official Ticketmaster and venue rollouts later this week.

## **Tickets + Presale Info**

Presales begin this week through the bands’ official fan clubs and Live Nation, with general on-sale dates set for Friday. VIP upgrades, meet-and-greet options, and limited-edition merch bundles are expected to be available for both groups.

Given the combined drawing power of both artists — and widespread coverage from every major rock publication — demand is projected to be extremely high. Fans are strongly encouraged to secure tickets during presale windows.

## **Why This Tour Matters**

This is more than a typical co-headline run — it’s a collision of two influential scenes. A7X brings progressive, theatrical metal; Good Charlotte delivers decades-defining pop-punk energy. Together, they represent a generation that shaped alternative music from Warped Tour to stadium metal.

For longtime fans — especially millennials who lived through both bands’ rise — this tour is a rare chance to see two icons share the same stage during a full nationwide run.

Stay tuned for updates, full tour dates, and coverage as more details emerge.
