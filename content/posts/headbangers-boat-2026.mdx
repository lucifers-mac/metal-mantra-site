**[Headbangers Boat](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/headbangers-boat/)** is the definitive heavy metal cruise — a floating festival curated and headlined by [Lamb of God](https://metal-mantra.com/lamb-of-god-stubhub-flub/), built by metalheads, for metalheads. The 2026 edition sails from Miami to Great Stirrup Cay, Bahamas aboard the Norwegian Jewel from October 30 through November 3. This guide covers everything you need to know: the full lineup, cabin options, pricing, what’s included, what to pack, and whether this cruise is worth booking.

## What Is Headbangers Boat?

Headbangers Boat is a four-night heavy metal cruise organized by Lamb of God and Sixthman, the company behind ShipRocked and other music-at-sea events. It launched in 2023 and has run every year since, establishing itself as one of the most respected niche festivals in extreme music. Every band on the lineup plays multiple sets. Every show is general admission. There’s no VIP barricade, no genre tourism, no pop crossover filler — just stages, pits, bars, and thousands of metalheads who know exactly why they’re there.

Unlike land-based festivals where you camp in dirt and pray for shade, Headbangers Boat puts you on a fully equipped cruise ship with restaurants, pools, hot tubs, a casino, and a fitness center. Between sets, the ship stays alive with artist Q&As, DJ sets, podcast recordings, fan meetups, and late-night bar conversations that turn strangers into lifelong allies. The intimacy is the real difference — you eat where the bands eat, drink where they drink, and there’s nowhere to hide from a good time.

## Headbangers Boat 2026 Dates, Ship and Route

**Dates:** October 30 – November 3, 2026 (4 nights)
**Ship:** Norwegian Jewel
**Departure:** Miami, Florida
**Port of Call:** Great Stirrup Cay, Bahamas (Norwegian’s private island)
**Return:** Miami, Florida

The Halloween timing is deliberate. Costumes take over the ship, stage lights hit harder after dark, and the entire experience leans into controlled chaos. The Norwegian Jewel holds roughly 2,400 passengers and has hosted every Headbangers Boat voyage since the event’s inception.

## Headbangers Boat 2026 Full Lineup

The 2026 lineup doesn’t play it safe. It leans heavy, weird, aggressive, and unapologetically metal. Every act performs multiple sets throughout the voyage.

### Headliners and Anchors

**[Lamb of God](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/lamb-of-god/)** command the ship once again. At this point, Headbangers Boat is as much their domain as any stage they touch. These sets hit harder knowing there’s no barricade between band and crowd — just deck railings and ocean air.

**Zakk Sabbath** delivers Black Sabbath worship the right way — loud, low, and filthy. Doom riffs hit different surrounded by saltwater and sunburned necks snapping in unison.

### Extreme and Legacy Acts

**The Dillinger Escape Plan** bring controlled chaos to open water, turning mathcore into something borderline dangerous when there’s nowhere to escape. **In Flames** represent Swedish melodeath royalty, balancing melody and aggression with surgical precision.

**[Death Angel](https://metal-mantra.com/death-angel-act-iii-tour-2026/)** keep thrash alive and feral. **The Haunted** and **D.R.I.** inject old-school violence that still feels relevant decades later.

### Brutality, Sludge and Hardcore

**All Shall Perish** return with deathcore devastation. **200 Stab Wounds** keep things bloody and blunt. **Harm’s Way** provide hardcore heaviness that hits like concrete. **Kylesa** bring sludge-soaked atmosphere while **Soilent Green** inject grimy Southern extremity.

Add in **GWAR** for theatrical destruction, **X-Cops** for cult chaos, plus appearances from **Mark Morton Band** and **Chained Saint**, and you’ve got a lineup that refuses to sit still.

**Full 2026 Lineup:** Lamb of God, Zakk Sabbath, The Dillinger Escape Plan, In Flames, GWAR, The Haunted, Death Angel, All Shall Perish, Kylesa, D.R.I., Harm’s Way, Soilent Green, 200 Stab Wounds, Chained Saint, X-Cops, Mark Morton Band, and more.

## Cabin Categories and Pricing

All prices are per person, include $320 in taxes and port fees, and are based on double occupancy. Third and fourth guests pay reduced rates. Solo travelers pay a premium. Cabins historically sell fast — the 2025 voyage hit 90% capacity before the full lineup was even announced.

**Interior (138 sq ft)** — Starting at $1,470/person (2 guests). Queen bed, TV, private bathroom, sitting area. Decks 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11. The budget pick. You won’t spend much time in the room anyway.

## What to Expect Onboard

Between sets, the Norwegian Jewel stays alive. Expect artist Q&As, DJ sets (including spins from Lamb of God’s Art Cruz), podcast tapings, fan events, merch tables everywhere, and late-night bar sessions that blur the line between fans and artists. Halloween costumes take things further — because subtlety was never part of the deal.

The ship has multiple performance venues spread across its decks. Shows run from afternoon through late night. Every band plays at least twice, so you won’t have to choose between two acts you love — just catch them at different times. All shows are general admission, no reserved seating, no wristband tiers. Show up, find your spot, and hold your ground.

Dining is included in your fare. The Garden Cafe buffet (Deck 12) and Great Outdoors grill are free and open throughout the day. The main dining rooms serve sit-down gourmet meals. Specialty restaurants like Cagney’s Steakhouse ($60 dinner, $17.50 lunch) and Chin Chin Asian ($50) charge a cover. You won’t go hungry — the question is whether you can eat between sets fast enough to make the next one.

## Great Stirrup Cay — The Shore Day

The ship stops at Great Stirrup Cay, Norwegian Cruise Line’s private island in the Bahamas. Guests are tendered from the ship to shore on small boats — a short ride with a solid first look at turquoise water and white sand. On the island, food and drinks from the ship’s complimentary restaurants are available at no extra charge.

Activities on the island include beach lounging, snorkeling, a zipline course that starts from the island’s lighthouse, wave runner tours, and kayaking. There’s also a spa area in the Silver Cove section and private villa rentals for groups who want something more exclusive. Most of the paid excursions are optional — the beach, chairs, and basic food are included.

For past Headbangers Boat voyages, the island day has included acoustic performances and laid-back sets on the beach. It’s the one day where the intensity dials back — slightly.

## A Brief History of Headbangers Boat

Headbangers Boat launched in 2023 — a borderline insane idea that worked. Put extreme metal on a cruise ship, give Lamb of God the keys, and let thousands of metalheads loose for four days. It sold. It delivered. It came back.

**2023:** The inaugural voyage featured Lamb of God, Mastodon, Hatebreed, Testament, GWAR, Shadows Fall, God Forbid, Municipal Waste, Lacuna Coil, Vio-Lence, Gatecreeper, Malevolence, Bleed From Within, and Dying Wish.

**2024:** The lineup expanded with Lamb of God, Dethklok, Chimaira, At the Gates, Soulfly, Exodus, Napalm Death, Carcass, Corrosion of Conformity, Poison the Well, After the Burial, Currents, Bleeding Through, Unearth, EYEHATEGOD, Frozen Soul, and UnityTX.

**2025:** Sailed from Miami to Cozumel, Mexico. Featured Lamb of God, Clutch, Obituary, DevilDriver, Fear Factory, The Black Dahlia Murder, Kublai Khan TX, Power Trip, Crowbar, The Exploited, Eighteen Visions, and more. Hit 90% capacity before the full lineup dropped.

Each year, the cruise has earned credibility by staying focused. No genre tourism. No pop crossover experiments. Just metal, presented the way it should be — loud, sweaty, and unfiltered.

## Headbangers Boat FAQ

### Do I need a passport?

Strongly recommended but not technically required for U.S. citizens. Since the cruise departs and returns to Miami, you can board with a birth certificate plus government-issued photo ID under the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative. A passport card or enhanced driver’s license also works. That said, Sixthman strongly recommends a passport — it speeds up disembarkation and lets you fly home from a foreign port if something goes sideways. Non-U.S. citizens should check Norwegian’s travel documentation requirements.

### Can I buy a single-day pass?

No. Headbangers Boat is a full cruise booking. You’re on the ship for the entire four-night voyage. There are no single-day tickets, no port-only passes, and no partial bookings.

### Is there an age limit?

Children as young as 6 months can sail (with a paying adult). Norwegian’s youth program is available onboard with limited capacity. The minimum drinking age is 21 for all alcohol, though guests 18–20 can purchase beer and wine when the ship is in international waters (3+ miles from U.S. territory) with parent/guardian approval at the front desk.

### Are refunds available?

All deposits and payments are non-refundable. If you want protection, buy the travel insurance at booking. The standard policy covers cancellations at 100% for covered reasons. The Cancel for Any Reason add-on reimburses up to 50% when cancelled at least 48 hours before sailing.

### Can I bring my own alcohol?

No. Norwegian prohibits bringing alcohol onboard (wine and champagne excepted). Anything purchased at port is stored by the ship until debarkation. Alcohol packages are available for purchase separately.

### How do I book?

All bookings go through the official [Headbangers Boat website](https://www.headbangersboat.com/). This is a Sixthman event — cabins are not available through Norwegian directly or through third-party travel agents. Book early. These sell out.

## What to Pack for Headbangers Boat

Pack for a cruise, not a festival campground. You’ll have a real room, real showers, and real air conditioning. That said, some essentials are easy to forget.

**[Earplugs](https://amzn.to/49OB60j)** — Non-negotiable. Multiple indoor stages on a ship means the volume is relentless. Bring quality ones.

**Sunscreen** — Pool deck, island day, and outdoor stages will roast you

**Comfortable shoes** — You’ll be on your feet for 16+ hours a day

**Halloween costume** — It’s Halloween at sea. Participate.

**Reusable water bottle** — Filtered water stations are free throughout the ship

**Lanyard for your ship card** — Your room key is also your payment card and ID onboard

**Passport or birth certificate + photo ID** — Don’t forget the documentation or you’re not boarding

**Ibuprofen** — For the mornings after

## Is Headbangers Boat Worth It?

If you love extreme music, community, and controlled chaos — yes, absolutely. The math works out: an interior cabin at $1,470/person covers four nights of lodging, all meals, and unlimited access to 15+ bands playing multiple sets each. Try getting that deal at any land festival once you factor in hotels, food, and parking.

The real value is what you can’t put a price on. The intimacy of seeing bands you worship in a setting where there’s no barrier between them and you. The community of a few thousand people who all chose to be there for the same reason. The complete removal from the outside world for four days — no cell service (unless you pay for Wi-Fi), no traffic, no obligations beyond deciding which set to hit next.

If you need quiet mornings, early bedtimes, or polite applause, look elsewhere. Headbangers Boat isn’t a vacation. It’s a commitment. For the right crowd, it’s unforgettable. Miss it, and you’ll hear about it for years.
