Iron Maiden’s discography is a towering legacy in heavy metal, spanning **17 studio albums** from their self-titled debut in 1980 to their latest epic in 2021. Over more than four decades, the band evolved from the raw [New Wave of British Heavy Metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_wave_of_British_heavy_metal) sound of their early days to the elaborate progressive epics of recent years, selling over [100 million records worldwide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Maiden) and influencing countless artists along the way. Every fan has their own opinion on which albums reign supreme. Here, on our fan-driven site, we’re taking on the challenge of ranking Iron Maiden’s studio albums from worst to best – a subjective journey through [Iron Maiden](https://ironmaiden.com) history that celebrates the highs, notes the lows, and honors the band’s unparalleled legacy. More metal news: [News hub](https://metal-mantra.com/news/).

Each album contributed something to Iron Maiden’s story, whether it was a lineup change, a bold musical experiment, or a classic that defined a generation. From the [Blaze Bayley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaze_Bayley)-era struggles in the 1990s to the triumphant [Bruce Dickinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Dickinson)-led reunion albums of the 2000s, from the anthems that fill stadiums on tour to deep cuts beloved by diehards – they’re all part of the legacy. Strap on your bullet belt and grab your Eddie posters: let’s dive into Iron Maiden’s catalogue and see how the albums stack up.

## 17. Virtual XI (1998)

It’s no surprise that *Virtual XI* lands at the bottom of our list. The second (and final) Iron Maiden album with vocalist Blaze Bayley, *Virtual XI* suffered from a lack of inspiration and identity. Coming off the lukewarm reception of *The X Factor*, the band attempted to recapture old glory, but the result was widely seen as a misstep. The production is oddly weak and the songwriting feels flat. Even a few decent moments – “The Clansman” in particular is a rousing epic that survived in live sets with Bruce back on vocals – can’t save the album from its reputation. “The Angel and the Gambler,” with its endlessly repeated chorus, has become infamous among fans for all the wrong reasons. Every great band has a low point, and for many, *Virtual XI* is it. (If you’re still curious or completing your collection, *Virtual XI* is available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+Virtual+XI).)

## 16. The X Factor (1995)

Iron Maiden’s first album without Bruce Dickinson was *The X Factor*, introducing Blaze Bayley as frontman. Blaze had a distinctly different, darker vocal style, and the band’s music followed suit – *The X Factor* is a sombre, brooding affair. To its credit, the album dared to be different, with longer songs and introspective lyrics reflecting a turbulent time for band leader Steve Harris. “Sign of the Cross” is an 11-minute centerpiece that showed Iron Maiden could still write grand epics (Bruce would later sing it live to great effect), and “Lord of the Flies” and “Man on the Edge” are solid tracks. However, the overall tone is unrelentingly dark and the energy level never quite reaches the galloping highs Maiden is known for. Many fans appreciate *The X Factor* for its atmosphere, but others find it a difficult listen. It remains a polarizing entry in the discography, and in our ranking it only rises above *Virtual XI*. (Find *The X Factor* on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+X+Factor) if you’re looking to explore this chapter of Maiden history.)

## 15. No Prayer for the Dying (1990)

After an incredible run of classic albums in the 1980s, Iron Maiden hit a bump in the road with *No Prayer for the Dying*. This 1990 release saw a major lineup change – guitarist Adrian Smith departed, and Janick Gers stepped in. The band also stripped down their sound, aiming for a rawer, more straightforward heavy metal approach after the polished, synth-infused production of the late ’80s. The result was a mixed bag. On the one hand, *No Prayer* gave Maiden their first (and only) UK #1 single with the tongue-in-cheek “Bring Your Daughter… to the Slaughter.” It also features fan-favorite “Holy Smoke”, a cheeky rocker, and a soulful title track “No Prayer for the Dying.” On the other hand, much of the album felt undercooked compared to what came before. Bruce Dickinson’s vocals were noticeably rougher as he experimented with a raspier style, and the songwriting lacked the epic scope of earlier records. While not without its charms, *No Prayer for the Dying* is often regarded as a downgrade from the brilliance of the 1980s albums. (You can revisit *No Prayer for the Dying* on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+No+Prayer+for+the+Dying) and decide if it’s an underrated gem or rightly ranked low.)

## 14. Fear of the Dark (1992)

Iron Maiden closed out their first Bruce Dickinson era with *Fear of the Dark*, an album that splits opinion among fans. On release in 1992, it received a warm commercial reception (even hitting #1 on the UK charts), but critically it showed signs of creative fatigue. *Fear of the Dark* is notably uneven: it contains some absolute killers along with some filler that drags it down. On the bright side, the iconic title track “Fear of the Dark” has become one of Iron Maiden’s greatest live anthems – its eerie intro and galloping climax drive crowds wild, and it’s a staple in concert setlists. Other strong cuts include “Afraid to Shoot Strangers”, with its dynamic build-up, and “Be Quick or Be Dead”, a frantic opener that proved Maiden could still thrash with the best of them. However, the album is padded with songs like “Weekend Warrior” and “Chains of Misery” that are generally forgotten even by dedicated fans. Following this album, Bruce Dickinson left the band for a few years, making *Fear of the Dark* a poignant end to an era. While it’s far from Maiden’s worst, its inconsistency lands it in the lower half of our list. (If you need *Fear of the Dark* in your collection, it’s available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+Fear+of+the+Dark).)

## 13. Dance of Death (2003)

The early 2000s saw Iron Maiden enjoying a rejuvenation, but *Dance of Death* stands as a somewhat awkward follow-up to the triumphant *Brave New World*. Released in 2003, this album continued Maiden’s foray into longer, progressive-leaning songs, with mixed results. It’s impossible not to mention the cover art – a bizarre CGI mishmash that many fans consider the worst cover in Maiden’s catalog – but beneath that, *Dance of Death* has its highlights. “Paschendale,” for instance, is an absolute masterpiece: an epic retelling of a World War I battle, rich with atmosphere and one of Maiden’s best post-2000 songs. The title track “Dance of Death” is another standout, a story-driven piece that harks back to the theatrical feel of old classics. There are also fun, shorter tracks like “Wildest Dreams” and “Rainmaker,” which the band took on tour. However, not every song hits the mark (tracks like “Gates of Tomorrow” or “New Frontier” are often overlooked), and the production feels a bit muddy. Overall, *Dance of Death* ranks mid-to-low in Maiden’s discography – worthwhile for its high points, but uneven enough to keep it out of the top tier. (Check out *Dance of Death* on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+Dance+of+Death) to hear its unique blend of the great and the not-so-great.)

## 12. The Final Frontier (2010)

On *The Final Frontier*, Iron Maiden took their sound to outer space – literally and figuratively. This 2010 album has a futuristic theme, kicking off with the experimental intro “Satellite 15… The Final Frontier” that surprised many fans with its droning bass and echoing drums before exploding into a classic Maiden gallop. *The Final Frontier* is an ambitious effort that earned the band a lot of late-career recognition: it debuted at #1 in 20+ countries and even garnered Iron Maiden their first Grammy Award (for the stomping single “El Dorado”). Musically, the album continues the band’s progressive streak, with lengthy tracks like “When the Wild Wind Blows” and “Isle of Avalon” showcasing elaborate structures and introspective themes. There are plenty of highlights – “Coming Home” is a heartfelt, nostalgic anthem and “The Talisman” delivers vintage galloping drama – yet the album as a whole can feel a bit overlong and dense. Some fans feel *The Final Frontier* could have been trimmed for greater impact, but it’s undeniably a strong record that proved Maiden’s endurance. In our ranking, it sits lower mid-pack, reflecting an album that, while impressive, doesn’t quite reach the heights of the band’s very best work. (Explore *The Final Frontier* on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+Final+Frontier) if you want to experience Maiden’s space-bound adventures.)

## 11. A Matter of Life and Death (2006)

*A Matter of Life and Death* is often praised as one of Iron Maiden’s most cohesive and mature albums. Released in 2006, it presents a loosely war-themed collection of songs wrapped in a gritty, almost live-sounding production. Notably, the band was so confident in the material that they performed the entire album on tour — a bold move that split fan opinions at the time. The album itself is a grower: from the rallying cry of “Different World” to the intense build of “The Longest Day” and the philosophical weight of “For the Greater Good of God,” every track unfolds with purpose. The songwriting is deep and progressive; tracks like “Brighter Than a Thousand Suns” and “The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg” showcase complex structures and dark, heavy riffs that harken back to Maiden’s 80s epics, but with a modern twist. While *A Matter of Life and Death* didn’t produce any radio singles and eschewed any overt “hits,” it holds together as an album experience and has earned immense respect from fans who appreciate its depth. Its consistency and ambition earn it a solid spot just outside the top ten in our ranking. (If you’re interested in this powerful chapter of Maiden’s catalog, you can find *A Matter of Life and Death* on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+Matter+of+Life+and+Death).)

## 10. The Book of Souls (2015)

In 2015, Iron Maiden proved they still had grand creative ambitions with *The Book of Souls*, their first double studio album. Clocking in at over 90 minutes, *The Book of Souls* is an expansive journey that takes listeners through soaring highs and somber lows. It’s packed with memorable moments: “Speed of Light” delivers a punchy single with a classic Maiden feel (and a fun retro video game-themed music video to boot), while “Tears of a Clown” pays touching tribute to comedian Robin Williams. But the album’s crowning achievement is “Empire of the Clouds,” an 18-minute epic penned by Bruce Dickinson that tells the tragic tale of the R101 airship disaster with piano, strings, and dramatic storytelling – arguably Maiden’s most elaborate song ever. Throughout the album, Bruce’s vocals shine (all the more remarkable given he was battling cancer during the recording), and the band sounds inspired. If there’s a downside, some critics felt the length made it a bit unwieldy to digest in one sitting. Nonetheless, the sheer quality of songwriting and the band’s fearless approach to pushing their sound make *The Book of Souls* one of the standout records of their later years. It lands in the middle of our list, which in Iron Maiden’s case means it’s still darn excellent. (Experience the epic scope of *The Book of Souls* on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+Book+of+Souls).)

## 9. Senjutsu (2021)

The most recent studio album, *Senjutsu*, shows Iron Maiden aging like fine wine – with a dark, cinematic flavor. Released in 2021, *Senjutsu* (Japanese for “tactics” or “strategy”) finds the band building on the epic formula of their 2000s work. The album cover features Eddie as a samurai warlord, setting the stage for an album full of battle imagery and reflective mood. Musically, *Senjutsu* is bold and patient: songs like the title track “Senjutsu” and “Hell on Earth” are expansive and moody, while “The Writing on the Wall” brings a catchy, almost Southern-rock tinge to Maiden’s sound, and “Stratego” delivers a shorter burst of twin-guitar glory reminiscent of their classic days. At this point in their career, Iron Maiden isn’t chasing radio hits – instead, they’re crafting epic narratives set to music, and *Senjutsu* excelled at that, earning strong reviews and high chart positions worldwide. Some fans rank it among the band’s best work since the ’80s, whereas others feel it doesn’t quite match the nostalgia of the classics (it’s always tough for new material to compete with decades of legend). In our ranking, *Senjutsu* earns a spot in the upper-mid tier, a testament to Maiden’s continued vitality. After all, not many bands 40+ years in can drop an album of this scope and have it stand proudly alongside their legacy. (You can check out *Senjutsu* on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+Senjutsu&linkCode=ll2&tag=metalmantra-20&linkId=cb626a90abc1df0ce5c94556db3c4393&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) to hear Maiden’s latest chapter.)

## 8. Killers (1981)

The early Iron Maiden albums have a charm and ferocity all their own, and *Killers*, the band’s sophomore release, remains a fan favorite. This 1981 album was the second (and final) Maiden record with original vocalist Paul Di’Anno, and it marked the debut of guitarist Adrian Smith, solidifying the classic twin-guitar attack with Dave Murray. *Killers* took the raw energy of the debut and tightened it up, thanks in part to producer Martin Birch. The result? A New Wave of British Heavy Metal classic brimming with streetwise attitude and galloping riffs. Just listen to the opening instrumental “The Ides of March” leading into “Wrathchild” – it’s an adrenaline rush that announces a band on the rise. Other highlights include the sinister “Killers” title track, the melodic “Prodigal Son”, and fan-beloved deep cuts like “Purgatory.” Di’Anno’s gritty, punk-tinged vocals give these songs a different edge compared to the Bruce era, and many fans treasure that diversity in Maiden’s catalog. While *Killers* doesn’t have the arena anthems that later albums would deliver, it’s pure, hungry Iron Maiden with a legacy of its own. In our ranking, it sits comfortably in the upper half – a testament to its enduring appeal for those who love Maiden’s early years. (If *Killers* is missing from your library, you can find it on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+Killers) and hear the raw power of Maiden 1981.)

## 7. Iron Maiden (1980)

Where it all began! Iron Maiden’s self-titled debut album from 1980 is more than just a historical artifact – it’s a raucous, rough-around-the-edges gem that launched one of metal’s greatest careers. *Iron Maiden* introduced the world to the band’s fast-and-furious musicianship and dark fantasy imagery (all embodied by their mascot Eddie glaring from the cover). With tracks like “Prowler,” “Sanctuary,” “Running Free,” and the proggy mini-epic “Phantom of the Opera,” the album showed a young, hungry band fusing the raw power of punk with the technical prowess of metal. Paul Di’Anno’s vocals brought a gritty, street-level vibe that perfectly matched the music’s intensity. Sure, the production is a bit unpolished compared to later albums (the band was unhappy with how the sound turned out, feeling it didn’t fully capture their live energy), but many fans argue that’s part of its charm. *Iron Maiden* made a significant impact in the UK, helping to spearhead the New Wave of British Heavy Metal movement. Decades on, songs from this record still feature in Maiden’s live shows, and the album remains a thrilling listen. Ranking it against the more refined Bruce-era classics is tough – how do you compare an apple to an orange that breathes fire? – but we’ve placed the debut at #7, reflecting both its importance and its raw listenability. (Revisit the album *Iron Maiden* on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+Iron+Maiden+1980) to feel the birth of the legend.)

## 6. Brave New World (2000)

A triumphant return. *Brave New World* wasn’t just another Iron Maiden album – it was a statement that the beast was back. Released in 2000, this record reintroduced Bruce Dickinson as lead vocalist and Adrian Smith on guitar, reuniting the classic six-man lineup (with Janick Gers staying on as a third guitarist). The impact was immediate and electric. *Brave New World* marries the classic Maiden gallop and melody with a fresh, modern production and a renewed sense of grandeur. The opener “The Wicker Man” is a fist-pumping anthem that announced Maiden’s new era in style (that chorus “Your time will come!” felt very fitting). “Blood Brothers” became an instant fan favorite with its heartfelt tribute vibe and sing-along chorus often dedicated to lost loved ones in concert. The album is rich with epics like “Dream of Mirrors,” “Ghost of the Navigator,” and the title track “Brave New World,” which showed the band embracing longer, atmospheric intros and elaborate arrangements that would define their 2000s output. Critically and commercially, the album was a success – proof that Maiden had plenty of fuel left in the tank. Many fans consider *Brave New World* the best Iron Maiden album outside of the 1980s, and it earns a well-deserved place in our top ten. In our ranking, it comes in strong at #6, reflecting its quality and importance in the Maiden legacy. (If you haven’t experienced *Brave New World* lately, grab it on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+Brave+New+World) – it’s a modern classic.)

## 5. Piece of Mind (1983)

By 1983, Iron Maiden were firing on all cylinders, and *Piece of Mind* captured a band at the height of their ’80s powers. This was the first album with drummer Nicko McBrain, who joined and immediately locked in perfectly with Steve Harris’s galloping bass lines. The result? One of heavy metal’s great albums. *Piece of Mind* is chock-full of classics. “The Trooper” alone cements the album’s legendary status – that twin guitar lead and galloping rhythm have come to symbolize Maiden at their gallant best (and it’s accompanied by Eddie waving a tattered Union Jack on stage to this day). “Flight of Icarus,” the album’s big single, gave Maiden their first taste of American radio play with its soaring chorus. Beyond the hits, nearly every track is beloved: “Revelations” showed off Bruce Dickinson’s songwriting and vocal drama, “Where Eagles Dare” opened the album with blitzkrieg intensity, and deep cuts like “Die With Your Boots On” and “Still Life” are fan favorites. There’s also the admittedly goofy “Quest for Fire,” often playfully mocked for its “dinosaurs and men” lyric – but hey, a little whimsy doesn’t hurt. Overall, *Piece of Mind* stands as an essential Maiden release that built upon the breakthrough of the previous album and further solidified the band’s global rise. In our ranking, it rounds out the top five. Up the irons! (You can find *Piece of Mind* on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+Piece+of+Mind) and experience one of the quintessential 1980s metal albums.)

## 4. Somewhere in Time (1986)

In 1986, Iron Maiden took a bold step into the future – sonically and thematically – with *Somewhere in Time*. After the exhausting World Slavery Tour, the band embraced some new technology, incorporating guitar synths to broaden their sound. The result was a lush, futuristic album that still roars with classic Maiden energy. *Somewhere in Time* often feels like Maiden’s most “1980s” album (in a good way): it’s big, it’s a bit experimental, and it’s loaded with atmosphere. The hit “Wasted Years” remains one of Adrian Smith’s finest songwriting moments, a perfect blend of melancholy and hard rock with an iconic guitar riff and a reflective message about time and home. “Stranger in a Strange Land,” with its cool groove and sci-fi Western vibe, became another fan favorite. And for the deep-cut connoisseurs, songs like “Sea of Madness” and “Alexander the Great” offer rich rewards – the latter closing the album with an epic history lesson that fans still campaign to hear live. Although no singles from this album charted as high as previous efforts, *Somewhere in Time* was a commercial success and has grown in stature over the years. It represented Iron Maiden not resting on their laurels and successfully exploring new territory. Many fans hold it as one of their top albums, and in our ranking it claims the #4 spot, just below the absolute cream of the crop. (Relive the space-aged majesty of *Somewhere in Time* via [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+Somewhere+in+Time&linkCode=ll2&tag=metalmantra-20&linkId=8c50953e3030323cd6233de993d35397&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) – it’s a journey through time every metalhead should take.)

## 3. Seventh Son of a Seventh Son (1988)

Concept album, anyone? *Seventh Son of a Seventh Son* saw Iron Maiden fully embrace a progressive rock ethos while still delivering all the metal fireworks fans craved. Released in 1988, this was the seventh studio album (aptly), and it built a loose concept around prophecy and mysticism, inspired by folklore about the “seventh son” having supernatural powers. Musically, *Seventh Son* is grand and cohesive. The band reintroduced keyboards/synth (this time via guitar synth and keys) even more than on *Somewhere in Time*, adding rich layers to their sound. The result is an album many consider the pinnacle of Maiden’s creative ambition. Take “The Evil That Men Do,” “Infinite Dreams,” or “The Clairvoyant” – each combines infectious hooks with intricate musicianship and lyrical depth. “Can I Play with Madness” gave Maiden one of their biggest hit singles, a surprisingly catchy and concise song amid the epics. And the title track “Seventh Son of a Seventh Son” is a tour de force: over 9 minutes of theatrical, progressive metal that ebbs and flows brilliantly (complete with a haunting choral section mid-song). The album’s consistency is remarkable; there’s no filler here, just one thematic piece after another. *Seventh Son* was also the last Maiden album of the 80s and marked the end of an era – after its tour, Adrian Smith left for a time and the band’s sound shifted in the 90s. Critically and popularly, this record often ranks near the very top, and we’re no exception: it claims the #3 spot on our list. Simply put, *Seventh Son of a Seventh Son* is Iron Maiden at their most epic and magisterial. (If you haven’t immersed yourself in this classic recently, find *Seventh Son of a Seventh Son* on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+Seventh+Son+of+a+Seventh+Son&linkCode=ll2&tag=metalmantra-20&linkId=04c8e276ffe3ed8ca0d1e19b48fa3032&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) and enjoy one of heavy metal’s finest hours.)

## 2. Powerslave (1984)

From the moment you see *Powerslave*’s cover – the imposing Egyptian-themed Eddie temple – you know you’re about to witness something monumental. And indeed, Iron Maiden’s 1984 masterpiece *Powerslave* is often heralded as one of the greatest heavy metal albums of all time. This is Iron Maiden at the height of their might. The album explodes out of the gate with “Aces High,” a ferocious opener about WWII fighter pilots that became a permanent live staple (often used to kick off concerts with an air raid siren wail). Right on its heels is “2 Minutes to Midnight,” a hard-rocking, politically charged anthem that gave the band a hit single and another concert favorite. The deep cuts on *Powerslave* are just as impressive – the eerie instrumental “Losfer Words (Big ‘Orra)” showcases Maiden’s musical tightness, while “Flash of the Blade” and “The Duellists” offer up galloping riffage and adventurous solos that lesser bands could only dream of writing. The title track “Powerslave” is a thunderous epic that finds Bruce Dickinson belting out mystic lyrics as if casting a spell, all culminating in the album’s grand finale: “Rime of the Ancient Mariner.” Clocking around 13 and a half minutes, “Rime” adapts Samuel Coleridge’s famous poem into a multi-part metal odyssey – it was the longest Maiden song for decades and remains a benchmark for prog-leaning metal composition. Beyond the songs themselves, *Powerslave* is significant for the mammoth World Slavery Tour that followed, where Iron Maiden toured the globe with their most elaborate stage show yet (captured on the legendary *Live After Death* album). Many fans and critics point to this era as Maiden’s peak, and it’s easy to hear why. *Powerslave* takes the #2 position on our list, narrowly missing the top spot only because that spot belongs to an album of truly beastly stature… (If somehow you don’t own *Powerslave*, do yourself a favor and grab it on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+Powerslave&linkCode=ll2&tag=metalmantra-20&linkId=19ee4583430eb6612831974e38438255&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) – this is essential metal history.)

## 1. The Number of the Beast (1982)

Here it is – *The Number of the Beast*, the album that transformed Iron Maiden from rising stars into heavy metal legends. This 1982 release was a turning point: it introduced Bruce Dickinson as the new lead vocalist, unveiled some of the band’s most iconic songs, and courted controversy that only boosted its fame. Simply put, *The Number of the Beast* is a cornerstone of metal. The tracklist reads like a greatest hits package: “Run to the Hills” with its galloping rhythm and soaring vocals became Iron Maiden’s breakout hit and a music video staple on early MTV. The title track “The Number of the Beast” is a dark, theatrical anthem (complete with a spoken word intro from the Book of Revelation) that had conservative groups in the ’80s branding Maiden as “satanic” – which, of course, only intrigued kids to crank it louder. And then there’s “Hallowed Be Thy Name,” the album’s closing epic, often cited as one of the best heavy metal songs ever written (it’s certainly a crown jewel in Maiden’s catalog, with its dramatic narrative of a condemned man’s last moments and an unforgettable guitar harmony section). But that’s just the big three; the album has no filler, from “Invaders” to “Children of the Damned” to “22 Acacia Avenue.” The energy, creativity, and confidence bursting out of *The Number of the Beast* are palpable, and it drove the band to new heights – it was their first album to hit #1 in the UK and put them on the map worldwide. Over 40 years later, it remains the yardstick against which Iron Maiden albums (and indeed many metal albums) are measured. For all these reasons, **The Number of the Beast** claims the #1 spot as Iron Maiden’s ultimate album in our ranking. Up the irons, and long live the Beast! (Celebrate this classic by revisiting *The Number of the Beast* via [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+Number+of+the+Beast&linkCode=ll2&tag=metalmantra-20&linkId=4e8c111fbbe4891bf3c996af5825cae1&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) – it’s mandatory listening for any metalhead.)

**Final Thoughts:** Iron Maiden’s discography is the stuff of legend. Few bands can boast such a consistent run of influential albums or inspire such passionate debate among fans about “which album is best.” Whether you favor the raw grit of the Di’Anno years, the epic grandeur of the ’80s Dickinson era, or the dark and adventurous journeys of the modern albums, there’s no doubt every Maiden record has its own magic. This ranking is one fan’s take on a nearly flawless catalog – even the lower-ranked albums have moments of greatness, and the top-tier records helped define heavy metal itself. 

As Iron Maiden continues to tour and possibly record new material, their legacy only grows. So cue up your favorite Maiden album (or discover a new one), and let the music take you on a flight through Icarus’s skies, over battlefields and ancient mariner’s seas, to worlds beyond. And remember, [Iron Maiden](/iron-maiden) will always *rock in peace*. \m/
