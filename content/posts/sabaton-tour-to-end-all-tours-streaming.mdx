Sabaton&#8217;s concert film *The Tour To End All Tours* has officially hit major streaming platforms, giving fans full access to the arena-scale production without waiting for another limited cinema run. The film was recorded during a sold-out show at the Ziggo Dome in Amsterdam, captured during the band&#8217;s massive 2023 European tour in support of *The War To End All Wars*.

**Where to watch:** [Amazon Prime Video](https://www.primevideo.com/detail/0JK8GKYLMM9QH0Q0FL5GRDWM1H/) | [Apple TV](https://tv.apple.com/movie/sabaton-the-tour-to-end-all-tours/umc.cmc.52mox4l4c649955joni3ye2gn) | [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=sabaton+the+tour+to+end+all+tours&#038;sp=EgIQBA%25253D%25253D) (purchase/rental)

The setlist pulls from across Sabaton&#8217;s catalog, leaning heavy on the theatrical war-history anthems that pack arenas across Europe. Tracks from *The War To End All Wars* share space with long-standing live staples, and the Ziggo Dome production — pyro, LED walls, the full Sabaton stage rig — translates well to the screen. It&#8217;s not a stripped-down &#8220;we pointed a camera at the stage&#8221; situation. This is a proper concert film with multi-camera work and polished audio mixing.

For the band, the Amsterdam show carries personal weight. Sabaton has noted that their earliest Dutch shows drew a handful of people. Filming a sold-out Ziggo Dome — one of Europe&#8217;s premier indoor venues — for a global streaming release marks a &#8220;how it started vs. how it&#8217;s going&#8221; milestone that the film doesn&#8217;t shy away from acknowledging.

The film originally had a limited theatrical run through Trafalgar Releasing before landing on streaming. If you missed it in cinemas, the home release loses nothing in translation — this is a loud, visually dense production built for big speakers and a dark room.
