German thrash metal legends Kreator have released their scorching new single “Satanic Anarchy,” taken from the band’s highly anticipated sixteenth studio album Krushers Of The World, due out January 16, 2026 via Nuclear Blast Records. More metal news: [News hub](https://metal-mantra.com/news/).

The song races forward with high speed thrash riffs, a massive, chant along chorus and a searing guitar solo, packing everything fans love about modern Kreator into just three and a half minutes of pure metal aggression.

The official “Satanic Anarchy” music video dives deep into frontman Mille Petrozza’s passion for classic horror cinema, paying tribute to Clive Barker’s 1987 cult favorite Hellraiser. Following on from previous single “Tränenpalast” and its Suspiria inspired visuals, the new clip reinforces Krushers Of The World as a dark, cinematic and horror driven chapter in Kreator’s discography.

Fans can [pre order and pre save](https://kreator.bfan.link/krushers-of-the-world) Krushers Of The World now and [stream or download](https://kreator.bfan.link/sasg) “Satanic Anarchy” on all major digital platforms.

## “A divine revolt of the mind” — Mille Petrozza on “Satanic Anarchy”

Speaking about the new single, Kreator mastermind Mille Petrozza describes “Satanic Anarchy” as both a call to arms and a tribute to the raw imagination of eighties horror.

“Hordes! I hope you will like our brand new video for the song ‘Satanic Anarchy’ off our new album Krushers Of The World. The lyrics speak about a divine revolt of the mind, breaking the spell of obedience, standing together against tyranny and igniting change where fear once ruled. The narrative part of the video takes us back to the cinematic masterpiece Hellraiser by the great Clive Barker. This is not a remake or a sequel, it is an echo, a tribute to the raw imagination of eighties horror where pleasure, pain and chaos shared the same key. Enjoy!”

Between the track’s militant, shout along chorus and the video’s hellbound imagery, “Satanic Anarchy” is positioned as a centerpiece of Krushers Of The World and essential listening for fans of classic and contemporary thrash metal.
