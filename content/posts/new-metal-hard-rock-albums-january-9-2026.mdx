## This Week’s Upcoming Metal & Hard Rock Releases — January 9, 2026

The release calendar doesn’t ease into 2026 — it kicks the door off the hinges. This week brings arena-ready hard rock, symphonic firepower, hardcore brutality, and more than a few curveballs from the underground. Here’s what’s landing and why it matters. More metal news: [News hub](https://metal-mantra.com/news/).

**Alter Bridge — *Alter Bridge* (Napalm Records)**

Alter Bridge double down on their legacy with a self-titled release that feels intentional, heavy, and built for longevity. Myles Kennedy sounds locked in, Tremonti’s riffs hit with confidence, and the band leans into what they do best without chasing trends. This is polished, muscular hard rock done right — the kind of record that lives on turntables, not playlists.

**Beyond The Black — *Break The Silence* (Nuclear Blast)**

Beyond The Black continue their ascent with an album that blends cinematic symphonic metal with modern hard rock hooks. *Break The Silence* leans emotional without losing weight, pairing orchestral drama with riffs that actually bite. This one’s designed for fans who want melody without sacrificing power.

**Bruit — *Monolith* (Re-Release, Pelagic Records)**

The re-release of *Monolith* gives Bruit’s towering post-metal opus another moment in the spotlight. Dense, atmospheric, and patient, this record thrives on slow builds and crushing payoff. If you missed it the first time, now’s your chance to experience one of the heavier mood pieces of recent years.

**Bullet — *Kickstarter* (Steamhammer)**

Bullet keep the engine running hot with a straight-shooting heavy metal record that favors grit over gloss. *Kickstarter* is all momentum — fast riffs, no-frills choruses, and a classic metal backbone that refuses to age out. Simple, loud, effective.

**Iotunn — *Waves Over Copenhell* (Metal Blade Records)**

Captured live and unleashed without mercy, *Waves Over Copenhell* showcases Iotunn at their most punishing. Blackened doom textures collide with towering atmospheres, making this less a live album and more a ritual recording. Cold, overwhelming, and immersive.

**Läjä Äijälä & Albert Witchfinder — *Circle Of Pain* (Svart Records)**

This collaboration drags punk venom through a swamp of doom and occult heaviness. *Circle Of Pain* feels confrontational and unpolished by design, leaning into discomfort rather than accessibility. Not for casual listening — and that’s the point.

**Lionheart — *Valley Of Death II* (Arising Empire)**

Lionheart don’t reinvent themselves — they sharpen the blade. *Valley Of Death II* is aggressive, direct, and engineered for the pit. Every riff swings like a hammer, every vocal line dares you to stand still. Hardcore with purpose and zero filler.

**The Medea Project — *Live At Dingwalls* (Self-Released)**

Raw and unfiltered, *Live At Dingwalls* captures The Medea Project in their natural habitat — loud, chaotic, and emotionally charged. The imperfections work in its favor, making this feel like a document rather than a product.

**Nanowar Of Steel — *The Genghis Khan EP To End All Genghis Khan EPs* (Napalm Records)**

Nanowar Of Steel continue walking the fine line between parody and legitimately good metal. The jokes land, the riffs hit harder than expected, and the EP fully commits to its ridiculous premise. It’s dumb on purpose — and executed with skill.

**Push! — *Plowing Ahead* (Frozen Records)**

Modern aggression meets forward motion on *Plowing Ahead*. Push! deliver groove-heavy heaviness with a sharp edge, favoring momentum and punch over excess polish. A solid pick for fans of contemporary metal that still sweats.

**Semper Acerbus — *Following Omens* (Eclipse Records)**

Bleak, deliberate, and oppressive, *Following Omens* leans fully into doom’s suffocating embrace. This is slow-burn heaviness meant to linger, not entertain. Best consumed in one sitting, at maximum volume.

**Six Going On Seven — *Human Tears* (Spartan Records)**

Emotionally raw and musically abrasive, *Human Tears* balances catharsis and chaos. Screamo in its purest form — frantic, heartfelt, and unconcerned with polish.

**Uuhai — *Human Herds* (Napalm Records)**

Uuhai blur folk ritual and black metal ferocity into something primal and unsettling. *Human Herds* thrives on rhythm and atmosphere, pulling the listener into a trance that feels ancient and confrontational.
