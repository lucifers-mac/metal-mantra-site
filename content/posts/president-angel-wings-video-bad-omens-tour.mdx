UK-based collective PRESIDENT have released the video for new single &#8220;Angel Wings,&#8221; their first track under Atlantic Records. It&#8217;s the most direct signal yet that PRESIDENT are building toward something larger — a mix of alt-rock, industrial texture, and programmed beats that sits at the heavier end of the band&#8217;s sonic range without fully crossing into metal territory. The band describes the song as exploring &#8220;spiritual redemption and the resolve to begin again,&#8221; and frames it as the opening of a new chapter.

&#8220;Angel Wings&#8221; follows PRESIDENT&#8217;s 2025 debut EP *King of Terrors* and arrives as their first release for Atlantic Records. The band operates deliberately under a cloak of minimalism and anonymity — no press photos, controlled rollouts, no social noise — which has made each release land with more weight than the typical promo cycle. They told *Revolver* in a cover feature that they wanted to step back from &#8220;the conveyor belt&#8221; of modern music industry churn. The approach is working. Multi-million streams and a Revolver cover without having played a headline show yet.

PRESIDENT are currently mid-tour opening for [Bad Omens](https://metal-mantra.com/review-left-for-good-bad-omens/) and Beartooth on a North American arena run through March 27. Remaining dates include TD Garden in Boston (March 11), Xfinity Mobile Arena in Philadelphia (March 13), Bridgestone Arena in Nashville (March 17), American Airlines Center in Dallas (March 19), and the Kia Forum in Inglewood (March 26). For a band still on their first EP, these are rooms that will do their reputation real work. [Tickets for remaining dates are available now.](https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dbad%2Bomens)
