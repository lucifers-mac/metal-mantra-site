## Rob Zombie Releases *The Great Satan* — Out Now

*The Great Satan* is out today via Nuclear Blast and landing well. Zombie’s eighth solo record is a 15-track industrial-horror-metal-cinema sprawl that marks the return of guitarist Riggs (his first since *The Sinister Urge*) and bassist Blasko (his first since *Educated Horses*). Nobody else is making records that sound like haunted drive-in theaters, and Zombie sounds locked in rather than coasting. Highlights include “Tarantula,” the swampy “Sir Lord Acid Wolfman,” and the closer “Grave Discontent,” which plays like the end credits of a 1970s giallo film. Pitchfork is mixed, but Pitchfork is always mixed on Rob Zombie — the metal press is calling it one of his strongest in over a decade.

## At the Gates Announce *The Ghost of a Future Dead* — Tomas Lindberg’s Final Album

At the Gates have officially announced *The Ghost of a Future Dead*, due April 24 via Century Media. This is founding vocalist Tomas Lindberg’s final recorded work — completed more than two years ago, before his death in September 2025 from complications related to cancer treatment. Lindberg tracked his vocals in a single day, largely in one take, the day before major surgery. The first single “The Fever Mask” is out now with a video. The band describes the album as his legacy, and they’re not wrong. This is one of melodic death metal’s most important voices signing off on his own terms. Mark the date.

## Lamb of God Drop “Blunt Force Blues” — Final Single Before *Into Oblivion* Drops March 13

The last preview track before *Into Oblivion* arrives March 13 via Epic Records, and “Blunt Force Blues” is one of the more grounded songs Lamb of God have released — rooted directly in the Richmond, Virginia scene that built them. The 10-track album was produced and mixed by longtime collaborator Josh Wilbur, and includes previously released singles “Parasocial Christ” and “Sepsis.” Pre-orders are live now with limited vinyl variants and a collectible CD edition bundled with a companion zine featuring album art sketches, handwritten lyrics, and unseen studio photos. To back the release, Lamb of God have organized a 140+ store independent record shop listening party series running March 13–15. A spring North American tour follows.

## August Burns Red Return to Fearless Records, New Single “Behemoth” and North American Tour Announced

Label homecoming with teeth. August Burns Red have re-signed with Fearless Records — the label that launched them — and dropped new single “Behemoth” to mark the occasion. JB Brubaker calls it “one of the heaviest and most raw songs we’ve ever delivered,” describing it as a track about cutting ties with the past and refusing to let it occupy the present. The co-headline North American tour with The Amity Affliction kicks off April 10 in Worcester, MA and runs through May 17, with support from Boundaries and Heavensgate. Over 20 dates across the U.S. including Atlanta, Dallas, Phoenix, Anaheim, and more.

## Zakk Wylde Confirms Black Label Society’s *Engines of Demolition* — March 27

Four years in the making and finally dated. *Engines of Demolition* drops March 27 via Spinefarm, the follow-up to 2021’s *Doom Crew Inc.* Wylde began composing during the Pantera tribute touring cycle in 2022, and the constant road time kept pushing the finish line further out — but the record was completed in 2025. Wylde describes it as “a sincere ride through the peaks and valleys of the last four years, some of the highest highs and lowest lows and everything in between.” The BLS tour is already underway as of today, with lead single “Name in Blood” out now. The first studio album in nearly five years from one of metal’s most consistent workhorses.
