The calendar flipped, the hangovers here, and metal wasted no time reminding everyone that the scene never actually sleeps. While the rest of the world was busy pretending January 1 means a clean slate, heavy music came out swinging — unresolved drama, veteran perspective, underground reunions, and a tour announcement that reads like a concussion protocol. This is where things stand right now. Catch more in the [latest Rundown](https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/).

## Nick Pierce Breaks His Silence on As I Lay Dying — and It’s Not Pretty

After months of speculation and side-eye from fans, As I Lay Dying drummer Nick Pierce finally said the quiet part out loud. According to Pierce, the band gave Tim Lambesis a legitimate second chance — not a PR stunt, not a half-measure — and he still managed to blow it. No dramatic framing. No sympathy fishing. Just a blunt acknowledgment that the trust extended to Lambesis wasn’t respected.

What makes Pierce’s comments hit harder is how grounded they feel. This wasn’t an emotional outburst or a scorched-earth rant. It sounded like someone who’s already processed the disappointment and moved on. As I Lay Dying’s post-prison era was always going to be fragile, and Pierce’s words confirm what many suspected: the collapse wasn’t sudden, and it wasn’t unfair. The band tried to rebuild. The foundation cracked anyway.

Metal forgives a lot. But it doesn’t forget patterns.

## Dave Mustaine Explains Why Megadeth Covered “Ride the Lightning”

Somewhere around the point where time humbles everyone, Dave Mustaine started speaking about Metallica like a historian instead of a rival. In explaining why Megadeth covered “Ride the Lightning,” Mustaine cut through decades of mythology and simply called it what it is: “a hell of a song.” No qualifiers. No backhanded compliments. Just respect.

The choice makes sense. “Ride the Lightning” isn’t just a Metallica track — it’s a structural beam in thrash metal itself. Mustaine knows that better than anyone. This isn’t Megadeth chasing relevance or playing nice for headlines. It’s a veteran acknowledging a moment that shaped an entire genre, including his own career. If anything, the lack of bitterness says more than any reconciliation narrative ever could.

## Megadeth’s Farewell Still Has Teeth — and an Exit Plan

Alongside the Metallica talk, Mustaine once again addressed Megadeth’s eventual farewell — and made it clear this isn’t going to devolve into a parody of itself. In his words, they’re not about to “Crüe-it-up” with endless goodbye tours and convenient reversals. It was said plainly, and it landed exactly how it was meant to.

Whether fans want to believe it or not, Megadeth’s exit strategy sounds deliberate. There’s no illusion that the band will disappear overnight, but Mustaine seems intent on closing the book with intention instead of dragging the story out for diminishing returns. In a scene where legacy acts often overstay their welcome, that restraint might end up being the most metal move of all.

## Former Mushroomhead Members Reunite as The Ex-Faces

Mushroomhead’s long and messy lineage took another turn this week with the announcement that six former members will reunite for two April shows under the name The Ex-Faces. Flint and Columbus will host the performances — which feels intentional, not random. These cities know the history. They lived it.

This isn’t a reunion tour or a rebrand. It’s a pressure release. Years of lineup fractures, legal nonsense, and creative detours finally boil down to a couple of nights where the music gets to exist without footnotes. For fans who fell off somewhere along Mushroomhead’s endless internal reshuffling, The Ex-Faces might feel less like nostalgia and more like closure.

## Chaos & Carnage 2026 Loads the Weapon

If subtlety was on your New Year’s resolution list, Chaos & Carnage 2026 is here to ruin it. Thy Art Is Murder will headline the touring extreme-metal pile-on, backed by Carnifex, Bodysnatcher, 200 Stab Wounds, Ingested, and a lineup designed to leave venues structurally compromised.

This tour has never pretended to be anything other than overwhelming, and 2026 looks no different. Thy Art Is Murder sitting at the top is a logical choice — precise, ruthless, and fully uninterested in accessibility. Chaos & Carnage remains a reminder that heavy music didn’t get softer just because the internet got louder.

New year or not, the message is the same: metal isn’t slowing down, and it’s not asking permission.
