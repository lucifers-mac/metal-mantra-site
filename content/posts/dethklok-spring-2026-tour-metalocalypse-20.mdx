Dethklok have announced a dedicated spring 2026 solo headline run kicking off April 26 at Chicago’s Aragon Ballroom and closing May 28 at Observatory North Park in San Diego. The five-date run — celebrating 20 years of Adult Swim’s *Metalocalypse* — also hits Los Angeles, Seattle, and Portland. Special guests are to be announced.

The headline dates run parallel to [the already-announced Amonklok Conquest Tour](https://metal-mantra.com/amon-amarth-dethklok-tour/), the co-headlining run with Amon Amarth and Castle Rat that stretches April 15 through May 21 across arenas and major venues nationwide. Between the two, Dethklok will be one of the most active metal acts of the spring season — bouncing between headline club shows and co-headline arena dates in a way that covers both ends of the audience.

The Amonklok run includes festival appearances at [Sonic Temple](https://metal-mantra.com/sonic-temple-2026/) in Columbus (May 17) and Welcome to Rockville in Daytona Beach (May 7), plus major arena stops in Brooklyn, Boston, Detroit, Toronto, Montreal, and Denver. Brendon Small and Gene Hoglan’s full multimedia production — animation, the full *Metalocalypse* aesthetic, and the brutality fans expect — will be the centerpiece of every show on both runs. [Tickets for all dates are available now.](https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Ddethklok)
