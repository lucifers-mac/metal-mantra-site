Death Angel are heading back out for the second leg of the **Act III U.S. Tour**, and they’re bringing Vio-lence and Incite along for the ride. The run kicks off **May 1 in Phoenix** and wraps **June 21 in Santa Cruz**, covering 35 dates across the country — including stops at Welcome To Rockville, Maryland Deathfest, and MKE Metal Fest.

The tour celebrates the **35th anniversary of *Act III*** with full-album performances every night. That’s not a greatest-hits set with one deep cut thrown in as a bonus — it’s the entire record, front to back, the way it was meant to be heard. For a band that came out of the Bay Area thrash scene and helped define its second wave, this is the kind of commitment that separates a real legacy tour from a nostalgia lap.

Vocalist Mark Osegueda said the first leg exceeded expectations: “Nightly we could see and even more-so hear it at every show. That you guys appreciated it beyond our wildest expectations.” The response was strong enough to warrant a second run — and this time the routing is deeper, hitting more mid-market rooms where thrash tours tend to hit hardest.

Pairing Death Angel with **Vio-lence** on the same bill is a Bay Area thrash double-header that doesn’t need a third name to sell it. Both bands came up in the same scene, and seeing them on the same stage in 2026 is the kind of package that rewards people who actually show up. **Incite** rounds out the bill with enough aggression to keep the energy locked in from doors to encore.
