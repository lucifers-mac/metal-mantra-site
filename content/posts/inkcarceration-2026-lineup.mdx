Inkcarceration doesn’t quietly announce lineups. It slams them down and dares you to keep up. More metal news: [News hub](https://metal-mantra.com/news/).

After pulling more than 90,000 people into the Ohio State Reformatory last year — a literal former prison turned pressure cooker for riffs, sweat, and bad decisions — **Inkcarceration 2026** is back July 17–19 with a lineup that feels deliberately unhinged in the best way possible. Over 65 bands. Three stages. Zero filler.

This isn’t a festival that hedges its bets. It stacks the deck.

**Friday** kicks the gates open with Disturbed, Papa Roach, Cypress Hill, and Hollywood Undead — a collision of eras that still works because these bands know exactly who they are and why people still show up. **Saturday** pivots hard as Bad Omens officially steps into true headliner territory alongside Gojira, The Used, and Sleeping With Sirens. **Sunday** shuts the lights off with Limp Bizkit, A Day To Remember, Motionless In White, and Ice Nine Kills — loud, theatrical, and completely on-brand for a festival that’s never been subtle.

“*Get busy living, or get busy dying*,” Ice Nine Kills frontman Spencer Charnas said, borrowing directly from *The Shawshank Redemption*. “*We’re thrilled to share our songs of living and dying when INK descends on Inkcarceration.*” If you’ve ever stood in that yard at night while the lights cut through the cell blocks, you already understand why that quote lands.

But Inkcarceration has never lived or died on its headliners alone. The depth is where it earns its reputation.

Machine Head. Jinjer. Hatebreed. Lorna Shore. Fit For A King. LANDMVRKS. Dying Wish. Sanguisugabogg. Norma Jean. Silent Planet. Born of Osiris. Spite. PeelingFlesh. Miss May I. Hardcore, deathcore, metalcore, industrial, and straight-up pit violence all sharing the same unforgiving space. This is the kind of lineup where stage-hopping is mandatory and conflicts are guaranteed.

Special moments are baked into the weekend. Sleeping With Sirens celebrate 15 years of *Let’s Cheers To This*. Rev Theory reunites. Alien Ant Farm marks 25 years of *ANThology*. Ohio acts like Starset, Miss May I, Sanguisugabogg, Wolves At The Gate, and others get home-field advantage — and that energy always hits harder inside these walls.

And then there’s the part no schedule can prepare you for.

Inkcarceration is chaos between sets. It’s getting tattooed inside a former maximum-security prison. It’s wandering cell blocks that once held real inmates while bass rattles the concrete. It’s dust storms ripping through circle pits, medics moving through crowds, bands stopping mid-set just to stare at the building they’re playing next to. Past years have delivered heat exhaustion, surprise guest appearances, spontaneous tattoos, and stories that sound fake until you meet three other people who were standing right there.

There’s a reason Danny Wimmer Presents keeps documenting this place. The *Paranormal Prison* series didn’t come out of nowhere — artists, crew, and fans have been swapping stories about strange experiences here for years. Whether you believe in that side of it or not, the atmosphere is undeniable.

DWP founder Danny Wimmer doesn’t downplay what this lineup represents. “*We’re fired up to welcome Limp Bizkit back to Inkcarceration. Their recent South American stadium run sent social media into overdrive. Having Bad Omens headline a DWP festival for the first time brings a whole new level of energy — and adding Disturbed makes this lineup an absolute powerhouse.*”

Inkcarceration co-founder Dan Janssen echoed that sentiment. “*After selling out every year since 2021, this summer brings one of our most in-demand lineups to date… combined with upgrades across the site, camping, and parking experience, we’re excited to welcome fans back for what will be the biggest INK yet.*”

Translation: this isn’t a victory lap — it’s an escalation.

All pass types — 3-day, single-day, GA, and VIP — are on sale now at [Inkcarceration.com](https://inkcarceration.com/), including layaway options, new student pricing for 2026, and GOVX discounts for military and first responders. Camping, RV packages, and hotel bundles are available, and anyone who’s survived an Ink weekend knows camping is where half the stories are born.

Inkcarceration lives in the same ecosystem as [Sonic Temple](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/sonic-temple/), [Welcome To Rockville](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/welcome-to-rockville/), and [Aftershock](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/aftershock-festival/) — but it plays by its own rules. The setting matters. The curation matters. And once you’ve watched a breakdown hit as the sun drops behind prison walls, normal festivals feel a little too clean.

Inkcarceration 2026 isn’t just another weekend on the calendar. It’s a test of volume, stamina, and commitment. And judging by its track record, it’s going to sell out — again.
