## Teen Metal Band CHAINED SAINT Release *Live at the Whisky a Go Go* EP

The **Chained Saint Live at the Whisky a Go Go EP** delivers a blistering snapshot of the teen metal band’s live power as they continue their rapid rise in modern thrash. More metal news: [News hub](https://metal-mantra.com/news/).

Teen metal band **Chained Saint** — comprised of **Ethan Kahn** (guitar), **Sebastian De Avila** (bass), **Cameron Cottrell** (drums) and **Sean Sterling** (vocals) — continue their rise as one of the most exciting young forces in modern heavy music. Born in a South Florida garage in 2022, the band fuse old-school thrash metal energy with a modern, hard-hitting edge that speaks directly to the realities of today’s youth.

In just a short time, Chained Saint have earned praise from heavy-music tastemakers including **Revolver**, **Guitar World**, **Loudwire**, **Metal Injection**, and **Miami New Times**, while Judas Priest legend **Rob Halford** has publicly backed the band’s shredding chops. Their breakout single **“Animosity”** landed in rotation on **SiriusXM Liquid Metal** and soundtracked the **WWE 2K24 DLC 4** trailer, putting the teen thrashers squarely in front of a global metal audience.

Alongside their studio success, the band have been building a reputation as a must-see live act. In 2024, Chained Saint hit major stages at **Welcome to Rockville**, **Rocklahoma**, **Louder Than Life**, and the revived **Vans Warped Tour**. Severe weather cut their Louder Than Life set short, but the day still turned into a viral moment when **Slaughter to Prevail** personally invited vocalist Sean Sterling to join them onstage, creating a piece of live metal history fans are still talking about.

### Band on the New Live EP

“We love playing in Los Angeles and love playing at the Whisky a Go Go,” the band shares. “Besides being an iconic venue, it’s intimate, and the energy is great. And there’s nothing like playing in front of a packed house.

“We talked about releasing a live EP between the *Blindside* album and the new music we’re releasing early next year. The August 15 show at the Whisky provided the perfect opportunity to show what it’s like to see us live. We were also able to capture the set on video, for all of the people who haven’t had the opportunity to see us live yet.”

### About Chained Saint and *Blindside*

Chained Saint formed in a South Florida garage in the summer of 2022 and quickly built a reputation for fusing the raw, organic riff power of classic ’80s thrash with contemporary heaviness. Their debut album ***Blindside***, released via independent label **Patriark Records**, distills that sound into eight tightly written tracks that hit with both technical precision and emotional weight.

Produced by **William DuVall** of **Alice In Chains**, *Blindside* was recorded and mixed entirely to analog tape. There were no computers used in the recording sessions, no AI, and no studio trickery — just real riffs played by real musicians pushing themselves to capture the most honest performance possible. The result is a modern thrash metal statement that still feels timeless.

From the raging opener **“Animosity”** to cuts like **“Stronger Than Stone (Blindside)”**, **“Neanderthal”**, and **“Free Reign”**, the record showcases the band’s ability to write hooks, riffs, and choruses that stick while keeping everything drenched in high-gain fury. For fans of classic thrash, new-school shred, and youth-driven heavy metal, Chained Saint are very much a band to watch.

Metal Mantra will continue to track Chained Saint’s rise across future releases, festival appearances, and tour announcements. Stay tuned to our [Metal News](https://metal-mantra.com/category/metal-news/) feed and follow our coverage of emerging thrash and heavy metal bands worldwide.
