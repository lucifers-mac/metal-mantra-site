excerpt: "Louder Than Life 2026 unveils its biggest lineup ever: Iron Maiden, TOOL, Pantera, My Chemical Romance, Gojira, Danny Elfman and nearly 200 bands across seven stages in Louisville this September."
---

Louder Than Life has officially dropped its full 2026 lineup — and it’s the biggest bill in the festival’s history. The Danny Wimmer Presents flagship returns to the Kentucky Exposition Center in Louisville on September 17–20 with nearly 200 bands across seven stages. Headliners are locked, the undercard is stacked, and a mystery guest plus a major “very special guest” are still to come.

This is the kind of lineup that resets the fall festival calendar. Louder Than Life is already DWP’s loudest weekend, but this year’s booking leans harder into breadth: legacy headliners, modern arena draws, metalcore heat, and a deep bench of reunions and exclusives.

## Louder Than Life 2026 — Dates, Location, Headliners

**Sept. 17–20, 2026** • Kentucky Exposition Center • Louisville, KY

**Thursday (Sept 17):** [Iron Maiden](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/iron-maiden/), [Pantera](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/pantera/), [Megadeth](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/megadeth/)

**Friday (Sept 18):** My Chemical Romance, Pierce The Veil, A Day to Remember

**Saturday (Sept 19):** Limp Bizkit, Papa Roach, Sublime

**Sunday (Sept 20):** TOOL, Gojira, Danny Elfman

## Why this year is a must

Louder Than Life has always been a scene-wide crossover point — metal lifers, core kids, punk diehards, and hard-rock crowds sharing the same concrete. The 2026 bill pushes that idea further: a heavy legacy spine with a modern, stacked middle that makes the four days feel like a festival and not just a compilation of setlists.

**Pantera’s only U.S. show of 2026**

**One of Megadeth’s final farewell performances**

**Danny Elfman’s first Eastern U.S. show in nearly a decade**

**All‑female‑fronted stage (Saturday):** Halestorm, In This Moment, Lindsey Stirling, Orianthi, Icon For Hire, Kami Kehoe, Diamante

**Reunion sets:** Circa Survive, Get Scared, Blood For Blood, Metal Church, Primer 55, Sent By Ravens, 40 Below Summer

**Album anniversaries:** Jimmy Eat World (25 years of *Bleed American*), Sleeping With Sirens (15 years of *Let’s Cheers To This*), The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus (20 years of *Don’t You Fake It*), Alien Ant Farm (25 years of *ANThology*), Red (20 years of *End of Silence*)

**Exclusive set:** Cavalera performing Sepultura’s *Roots* live for the first time in nearly a decade

**Special performances:** Skillet’s pyrotechnic set, Chad Gray “30 Years of Madness” solo performance, Loathe exclusive Midwest appearance, Alissa White‑Gluz debuting a new band

There’s also a deeper festival story in this lineup: DWP is lining up a full-season arc.
