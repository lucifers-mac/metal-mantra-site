Black Veil Brides have officially opened 2026 with a goddamn statement. The band’s new single “Certainty” and its blistering video are out now — and they’re way more than another pretty rock anthem. More reviews: [Review hub](https://metal-mantra.com/review/).

“Certainty” is the first real blood pumping from the veins of the BVB machine this year, and it smacks. Brooding riffs, Andy Biersack tearing through vocals like he’s pissed off at the universe, and a visual that’s as gritty and strange as that teaser with the goat and the hole he was digging. It’s a fresh chapter but it still feels unmistakably [Black Veil Brides](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/black-veil-brides/).

The song is slated for the band’s upcoming seventh album on Spinefarm later in 2026, and if this is any indication of what’s coming, we’re in for a bruising ride. Andy says the concept of certainty — that stubborn, close-minded prison of thought — is at the core of the record. It’s heavy in both theme and tone, inspired by the film *Conclave*, and it wears that influence on its sleeve without being pretentious about it.

The official video, shot in Bogotá and directed by George Gallardo Kattah, stitches together eerie performance footage with cinematic storytelling that makes a lot of the cookie-cutter Rock visuals look like amateur hour. It’s cinematic without being overproduced — hell, it’s one of the better BVB visuals in years.

If you’ve been sniping at BVB for “selling out” or “going soft,” shut up and listen first. Black Veil Brides are no strangers to controversy or reinvention, and with “Certainty,” the band continue to evolve — adding another chapter to their long, divisive history in modern metal. This is neither radio fluff nor another recycled emo-anthem. It’s a band with real chops pushing a dark concept and — no BS — nearly pulling it off.

What makes “Certainty” hit harder is that it doesn’t feel like a throwaway single or a label-mandated warm-up. This sounds like a thesis statement. If this track really is the emotional spine of the upcoming album, Black Veil Brides are leaning into darker questions instead of easy answers — and that’s a smart move in a scene that often plays it safe. Whether fans embrace it or argue about it for weeks, that tension is the point. Expect more details on the full album soon. For now, dive in, argue with your friends about it, and try not to get this riff stuck in your head.
