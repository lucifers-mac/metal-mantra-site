According to the estate, the documentary is in post-production and has been developed with full authorization and cooperation from those closest to Wayne, ensuring that his life and career are presented with accuracy, respect, and proper context.

## Evil Disco Aims to Tell the Full Static-X Story

*Evil Disco – The Rise, Fall, And Regeneration of Static-X* is intended to chronicle the complete arc of the band’s journey, beginning with the formation of Static-X in the mid-1990s and their breakthrough during the late 1990s industrial metal boom. The film will explore how Wayne Static’s vision helped shape the band’s signature sound, blending aggressive guitar work, electronic elements, and dance-influenced rhythms into what Wayne famously described as [“evil disco.”](https://static-x.org/blogs/news/evil-disco-the-rise-fall-and-regeneration-of-static-x)

The documentary is expected to revisit key moments in Static-X’s rise, including the release of *Wisconsin Death Trip*, which became a landmark album in the genre and introduced the band to a global audience. Through archival footage and firsthand accounts, the film will examine how Static-X carved out a unique identity during an era dominated by nu-metal and industrial crossover acts.

## A Focus on Legacy, Conflict, and Creativity

Beyond commercial success, the estate has indicated that the documentary will address the internal conflicts and personal struggles that shaped Wayne Static’s career. These aspects are seen as essential to understanding both the band’s evolution and Wayne’s creative drive, offering viewers a deeper look at the pressures and challenges faced behind the scenes.

The film will also examine the band’s eventual dissolution in the early 2010s, the circumstances surrounding Wayne Static’s passing in 2014, and the profound impact his death had on the metal community. Rather than sensationalizing these events, the estate has emphasized that the documentary seeks to present them as part of a broader narrative focused on artistic legacy and human experience.

## Regeneration and the Band’s Modern Era

A significant portion of the documentary will reportedly focus on Static-X’s rebirth following Wayne Static’s death. The band’s reformation and subsequent releases under the *Project Regeneration* banner marked a new chapter, allowing fans to hear previously recorded vocal material from Wayne while honoring his influence.

The estate-approved film is expected to explore how the remaining members approached this era with caution and respect, balancing the desire to continue performing with the responsibility of preserving Wayne’s legacy. This period has proven pivotal in reintroducing Static-X to a new generation of metal fans while reaffirming the band’s place in industrial metal history.

## Why the Estate Views This as the Definitive Documentary

According to the estate, *Evil Disco* represents the most complete and accurate portrayal of Wayne Static and Static-X to date. By combining archival materials, interviews with band members, and insights from those who knew Wayne personally, the documentary is designed to serve as an authoritative historical record.

The estate has stressed that maintaining control over how Wayne Static’s story is told is essential to protecting his legacy. As interest in documentaries about influential musicians continues to grow, the film is intended to stand as the official account, reflecting both Wayne’s artistic achievements and the complexities of his life.
