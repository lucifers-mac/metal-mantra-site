The midweek feed is heavy on tour movement, album rollouts, and one major lineup split. Here’s what matters right now.

## At The Gates Preview New Album, Confirm Final Record With Tomas Lindberg

At The Gates have started teasing *The Ghost Of A Future Dead*, billed as their final album with Tomas Lindberg. For a band this foundational to melodic death metal, that immediately raises the stakes around this cycle. If this truly closes the Lindberg chapter, expect every single, visual, and live date tied to this record to carry added weight with longtime fans.

## Exodus Drop “Goliath” Title Track, Album Lands March 20

Exodus just fired out the title track “Goliath,” with the full record due March 20. The early response is exactly what you’d expect: riff-first, no compromise, and built for pit conversion. With Napalm backing the release and a fresh content push underway, this looks like a core Q1/Q2 thrash anchor, not a one-off single cycle.

## Mushroomhead + Fear Factory Announce Fall Co-Headline Run

Mushroomhead and Fear Factory are teaming up for the “Soul Of A New War Machine” U.S. tour with Nine Treasures in support. Stylistically, this package makes sense: industrial precision, groove impact, and a support act that adds flavor without derailing the tone. This is the type of co-headline run that tends to perform strongest in established hard-ticket markets where both fanbases overlap.

## Converge Expand Spring Routing

Converge added more dates to their April North American run around the Poison The Well shows. Expansion this late is usually a demand signal, not filler. It also points to confidence in market velocity for this package, especially in hardcore-forward regions where lineup credibility drives decisions fast.

## Enter Shikari Lock East Coast Headline Dates

Enter Shikari return this June with a focused East Coast stretch, including Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Toronto. Compact regional runs like this usually hit well when there’s demand but no bloated routing. If room sizes stay tight, several of these dates will move quickly once local pushes kick in.

## Ingested Split With Vocalist Josh Davies

Ingested announced Josh Davies is out effective immediately, with Adam Mercer stepping in for touring duties. Any abrupt vocalist change creates real pressure on both communication and live execution in the next run of shows. This one will be watched closely for fan response as the band moves through upcoming dates.

## Poison The Well Drop “Everything Hurts” Ahead of New LP

Poison The Well released “Everything Hurts” from *Peace In Place*, their first new album since 2009. That gap alone makes this rollout one of the bigger comeback arcs in heavy music right now. If they keep this level of output consistency through release day, expect renewed catalog lift and strong nostalgia-plus-discovery engagement.

## Shinedown Address Rock The Country Exit

Brent Smith publicly addressed Shinedown’s decision to exit Kid Rock’s Rock The Country festival. Even outside strict metal lanes, this story is moving because it intersects artist positioning, promoter friction, and public narrative control. When bands step away from a major platform, the reasoning usually becomes part of the headline for weeks.

## Lovebites Sign With Napalm, Push New Video

Lovebites have signed with Napalm Records and launched a new video tied to their current cycle. Label shifts like this usually signal a stronger global infrastructure push across distribution, press, and tour strategy. If the rollout stays disciplined, this can be a meaningful growth phase for their international profile this year.
