[Knocked
Loose](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/knocked-loose/) have never been a band that “tries something” just to prove
they can. Every pivot they’ve made since *Laugh Tracks* has
felt like the next logical escalation: tighter writing, uglier tones,
more negative space, and an even sharper sense for when to cut the
floor out from under you. “Hive Mind” keeps that trajectory intact —
and the Denzel Curry feature doesn’t read like a label brainstorm or a
crossover-for-clicks move. It reads like two worlds that have been
orbiting the same aggression for years finally deciding to
collide. More reviews: [Review hub](https://metal-mantra.com/review/).

## The Sound and the Impact

Musically, “Hive Mind” hits like modern Knocked Loose should:
blunt-force riffs, a drum sound that feels like it’s breaking the room
into smaller rooms, and those trademark stop-start dynamics are where
the band weaponizes silence as much as sound. The opening doesn’t
waste time with scene-courting atmosphere or “let’s build to the
heavy.” It’s heavy immediately — not in the cartoonish “heaviest thing
ever” marketing way, but in the real sense that the guitar tone is
abrasive, the rhythm locks into that stomping, punitive pocket, and
everything around it exists to make the next impact land harder.

Garris remains one of the best frontmen in heavy music at making
urgency feel physical. His delivery is still that serrated bark, but
what makes it work is the phrasing: he doesn’t just ride the riff, he
argues with it. The words feel shoved out of him, like the band is
dragging him forward by the throat. That’s always been the Knocked
Loose advantage — the songs aren’t just “angry,” they’re
*activated*. You can hear it in how he paces lines against the
groove and how the band will pull back just enough to spotlight a
hook, then slam the door.

## Why the Feature Works (And Why It Doesn’t
Feel Forced)

The Denzel Curry part is where this could’ve gone sideways, and it
doesn’t. The secret is that Curry doesn’t show up to cosplay hardcore.
He shows up like Denzel Curry: percussive, rhythmic, and fast enough
to ride a beat that’s basically trying to throw him off. That’s the
difference — he’s not treating the feature like a novelty cameo. It’s
a performance that’s clearly written to *fit* the track’s
tension.

Crossover features in heavy music usually fail for one of two
reasons: either the guest sounds like they’re pasted on top of a
backing track, or the band sands their own edges down to accommodate
the guest. “Hive Mind” avoids both. Knocked Loose doesn’t soften the
music to create a “rap-friendly” moment; the band stays ugly and
physical. Curry, meanwhile, finds his lane inside that ugliness and
makes it feel natural — like the song had space carved out for him
without losing any pressure.

What “Hive Mind” does best is remind you that the
metal/hardcore/rap Venn diagram isn’t theoretical anymore. It’s how a
lot of people actually listen. If you grew up on breakdowns
*and* blast-your-car-subwoofers rap, this track doesn’t feel
like a fusion experiment. It feels like a statement of the obvious:
intensity is intensity, and the only thing that matters is whether
it’s convincing.

## The Video: Real Places, Real Grit

The video is the right setting for Knocked Loose’s brand of
claustrophobic violence. They’ve always felt like a band that belongs
in real places — basements, VFW halls, skate spots — not sterile
“performance clip” sets that try to make heaviness look expensive.
There’s a grit to that choice that matches their whole ethos.

Zooming out: “Hive Mind” also lands as a smart next step after
2024’s *You Won’t Go Before You’re Supposed To*. That record
widened their spotlight without turning them into a different band,
and a feature like this capitalizes on that momentum without feeling
like a surrender to it. If anything, it’s a flex: we’re bigger now,
and we’re using that reach to make heavier swings.

If there’s a knock against “Hive Mind,” it’s that Knocked Loose are
now so consistent at delivering this level of controlled brutality
that the shock factor isn’t what it was when they first started
pushing their sound into more jagged territory. But that’s not a real
problem — it’s what happens when you become the benchmark. The real
question is whether the song sticks, and between the pacing, the
feature, and the inherent replay value of that rhythmic violence, this
one has legs.

## Final Take

**Verdict:** “Hive Mind” is a legit collaboration, not
a marketing stunt — and it keeps Knocked Loose right where they’ve
been living: at the front of modern heavy music, dragging the rest of
the scene forward by sheer force.
