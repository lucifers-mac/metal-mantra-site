**HRADEC KRÁLOVÉ, Czech Republic —** Rock for People has unveiled another massive wave of artists for its 2026 edition, confirming two explosive new headliners: **Gorillaz** and **Limp Bizkit**. The announcement strengthens an already stacked lineup that includes **Iron Maiden**, **Bring Me The Horizon**, and more than 30 additional acts set to perform from **June 10–14, 2026** at **Park 360 in Hradec Králové**. We&#8217;ll keep updates rolling in our [Rock for People 2026 coverage](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/rock-for-people-2026/).

This marks the first **Gorillaz** show in the Czech Republic in nine years, and their long-awaited return will headline the festival’s opening day. The Grammy- and BRIT Award–winning virtual band, created by **Damon Albarn** and **Jamie Hewlett**, will arrive with tracks from their upcoming ninth album, *The Mountain*, due in March 2026, alongside timeless hits like **Feel Good Inc.**, **Clint Eastwood**, and **DARE**.

On Thursday, nu-metal icons **Limp Bizkit** take the stage as the day’s headliner, bringing decades of high-energy chaos led by frontman **Fred Durst** and the visually electrifying guitarist **Wes Borland**. The band, known for anthems like **Break Stuff** and **Behind Blue Eyes**, returns to Rock for People after 11 years.

Festival founder Michal Thomes celebrated the momentum:

“It’s great to see the lineup growing before our eyes. Having four headliners confirmed in mid-October is every organizer’s dream – and this is just the beginning.”

Rock for People 2026 is shaping up to be one of the festival’s most ambitious editions yet, extending once again to **five days** after a massively successful 30th anniversary year. With demand for tickets accelerating, organizers note the festival is nearing a sellout.

## Why Iron Maiden Anchors Rock for People 2026

With Gorillaz and Limp Bizkit adding chaos, color, and crossover appeal, it’s **Iron Maiden** who ultimately anchors Rock for People 2026 in heavy music history. When a festival places Maiden at the top of a lineup this diverse, it sends a clear message: this isn’t a nostalgia slot — it’s a standard being set.

That authority comes from **Iron Maiden’s legacy**. Decades of genre-defining albums, world tours, and uncompromising identity have turned their catalog into one of the most influential discographies in metal. Whether you’re there for nu-metal, alt-rock, metalcore, or extreme metal, Maiden’s presence reframes the entire weekend around scale, ambition, and longevity.
