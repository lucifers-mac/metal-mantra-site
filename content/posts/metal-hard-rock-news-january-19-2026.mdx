This was a messy, loud week in metal and hard rock. A long-rumored reunion tour dies in a very unglamorous way. One of metal’s most enduring institutions gets the documentary treatment it deserves. Shock rock icons join forces for a tour that will absolutely sell out. Festival season continues to flex its muscle. And Lamb of God remind everyone why they’re still one of the most dangerous bands on the planet. Catch more in the [latest Rundown](https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/).

## Poison’s 40th Anniversary Reunion Tour Officially Scrapped Amid Financial Fallout

Poison fans hoping for a full-blown 40th anniversary victory lap are officially out of luck—for now. Drummer Rikki Rockett has confirmed that plans for a reunion tour have collapsed due to internal financial disputes, effectively pulling the plug on what was shaping up to be a massive nostalgia-driven run. This wasn’t a scheduling issue or a health concern. This was money. Plain and simple.

Poison are no strangers to fractured timelines and selective appearances, but this one stings because it felt inevitable in the best way. The band’s legacy remains intact, their catalog still moves tickets, and their name alone commands attention. Yet behind the scenes, disagreements over financial structure and expectations reportedly made the tour unworkable. It’s a reminder that longevity doesn’t erase old tensions—it just gives them more history.

For fans, the disappointment is real. For the industry, it’s another example of how reunion economics can kill even the most bankable ideas. If this situation resolves, it’ll be because someone blinked—not because time healed anything. For now, Poison’s anniversary moment remains stuck in the rehearsal room.

## Judas Priest Documentary *The Ballad of Judas Priest* Set for World Premiere at Berlinale

Metal gods don’t need validation—but Judas Priest getting the full documentary spotlight at the Berlin International Film Festival feels right. *The Ballad of Judas Priest* is set to make its world premiere at Berlinale, bringing decades of defiance, leather, riffs, and survival to one of the world’s most respected film stages.

This isn’t just a career recap. Priest’s story is metal history—genre-defining albums, lineup changes, near-collapse, rebirth, and a refusal to fade quietly. From *British Steel* to *Painkiller* to their modern-era resurgence, the band has outlived trends, critics, and expectations. Seeing that story framed through a cinematic lens rather than a VH1-style gloss is a win for heavy music.

Expect deep archival footage, uncomfortable honesty, and the kind of perspective only time can provide. Judas Priest didn’t just influence metal—they armored it. This documentary will likely serve as both a celebration and a reckoning, and it’s long overdue.

## Rob Zombie & Marilyn Manson Announce Massive North American Tour

Love them or hate them, Rob Zombie and Marilyn Manson still know how to command attention—and this summer they’re doing it together. The shock rock heavyweights have announced a sprawling North American tour with The Hu and Orgy in support, creating a lineup that’s equal parts spectacle, aggression, and industrial chaos.

Zombie’s live show remains one of the most reliable visual assaults in modern metal touring, while Manson’s return to large-scale stages continues to spark conversation whether people want it or not. Add The Hu’s throat-singing, war-metal energy and Orgy’s late-’90s industrial resurgence, and you’ve got a bill designed to hit multiple generations at once.

This tour isn’t about subtlety. It’s about volume, imagery, and leaning fully into what these artists do best—provocation and excess. Expect packed sheds, heated debates, and zero attempts to play it safe.

## Rock Fest 2026 Lineup Takes Shape With Gojira, Limp Bizkit, The Offspring, and More

Rock Fest Wisconsin continues its evolution into one of the Midwest’s most stacked rock and metal gatherings, and the early 2026 lineup proves they’re not playing conservative. With Gojira, Limp Bizkit, and The Offspring leading the charge, the festival is once again bridging modern metal credibility with mainstream rock firepower.

Gojira’s presence alone elevates the bill, bringing precision heaviness and environmental fury to a crowd that knows how to move. Limp Bizkit remain a wild card that still pulls massive numbers, while The Offspring deliver reliable punk-rock catharsis. It’s a lineup built for scale, not niche appeal—and that’s the point.

As more bands are announced, Rock Fest 2026 is shaping up to be less about genre boundaries and more about sheer impact. This is festival booking with confidence.

## Lamb of God Announce New Album *Into Oblivion*, Drop Title Track, and Line Up 2026 World Tour

Lamb of God aren’t easing into their next era—they’re kicking the door off the hinges. The band has officially announced their new album *Into Oblivion*, unleashing the ferocious title track alongside news of a massive North American and European tour slated for 2026.

The new material sounds like a band with nothing left to prove and zero interest in restraint. It’s sharp, violent, and purposeful—classic Lamb of God energy sharpened by decades of road damage and studio discipline. This isn’t a nostalgia play. This is momentum.

Tour dates stretch across major markets and key festivals, positioning *Into Oblivion* as one of the most anticipated heavy releases of the year. Lamb of God continue to exist in that rare space where underground credibility and arena-level impact collide—and they’re not slowing down.
