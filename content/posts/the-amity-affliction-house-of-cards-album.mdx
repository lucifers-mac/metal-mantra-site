The Amity Affliction are entering a new era with *House of Cards*, their ninth full-length, landing April 24 via Pure Noise Records. The band also dropped the title track as the first taste of the record — and it hits hard both musically and emotionally.

*House of Cards* is the first Amity album to feature clean vocalist Jonny Reeves as a full-time member, bringing a fresh layer of vocal contrast to Joel Birch’s signature mix of confessionals and combustion. The title track in particular is rooted in family trauma, with Birch writing it for his brother and sister — and himself — while processing the complicated relationship they shared with their mother.

On the live side, The Amity Affliction are set to tour North America this spring with August Burns Red, Boundaries, and Heavensgate. They’re also hitting Australia in February and March with In Hearts Wake and RedHook, and they’ve been announced for Hellbound Metal Cruise 2027.
