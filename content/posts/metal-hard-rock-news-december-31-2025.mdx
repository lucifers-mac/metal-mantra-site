The year is crawling toward the finish line, but the metal world clearly didn’t get the memo to slow down. Lineup shake-ups, long-simmering comeback whispers, experimental veterans refusing to stay predictable, and yet another reminder that scenes still have reckoning to do — it’s all hitting at once. This isn’t end-of-year filler. This is the sound of bands repositioning, recalibrating, and in some cases, ripping the bandage clean off. Catch more in the [latest Rundown](https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/).

## Veil of Maya part ways with Lukas Magyar during hiatus

[Veil of Maya](https://amzn.to/4q1qv8d) have quietly but firmly closed the book on an era. Vocalist Lukas Magyar has officially exited the band during their current hiatus, confirming that he’s moving on and placing his full creative focus on [Sifyn](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/sifyn/). No public blowup. No messy social media warfare. Just a clean break — and honestly, that might be the most surprising part.

Magyar’s tenure with Veil of Maya marked a massive stylistic pivot for the band, pulling them further into melody-heavy, modern metalcore territory while still clinging to their technical roots. It worked. It also split opinions, depending on how allergic you are to clean vocals. Either way, his voice became inseparable from the band’s identity over the last decade, which makes this departure feel heavier than the low-profile announcement suggests.

The timing raises eyebrows. A hiatus exit always does. It suggests creative divergence rather than sudden chaos — a slow realization that the road ahead no longer runs parallel. With Sifyn now clearly his priority, Magyar seems ready to build something without the weight of legacy expectations. As for Veil of Maya, they’re once again staring down reinvention. It’s familiar territory for them, but that doesn’t make it any less risky.

## Disturbed start teasing new music, because of course they do

Just when it seemed like 2025 was finally running out of gas, [Disturbed](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/disturbed/) decided to light a match. After a relatively quiet stretch, the band has begun teasing new music, setting the internet into its usual cycle of speculation, hope, dread, and meme generation. Love them or roll your eyes at them, Disturbed still know exactly how to flip the switch.

This isn’t a band that operates on accident. Every tease is calculated, every breadcrumb dropped with full awareness of the reaction it’ll trigger. Disturbed occupy a strange space in modern metal — too heavy for mainstream rock purists, too accessible for extreme metal diehards, and completely unbothered by either camp’s approval. That stubborn middle ground has kept them commercially massive, even when critical opinion wavers.

The bigger question isn’t whether new Disturbed material will land, but what version of the band shows up. Another polished, arena-ready sledgehammer? A darker, more aggressive turn? Or something designed to start arguments all over again? Whatever it is, they’re not teasing unless there’s something ready to hit hard. 2025 clearly isn’t done swinging.

## Ulver announce *Neverland*, because staying still has never been the point

[Ulver](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/ulver/) have announced a new album titled *Neverland*, set to arrive digitally on December 31, with physical editions following on February 27, 2026. The first glimpse comes via the track “Weeping Stone,” and in true Ulver fashion, it’s less about immediate gratification and more about atmosphere, unease, and slow-burning intent.

This is a band that stopped caring about genre boundaries decades ago. From their black metal origins to orchestral soundscapes, electronic experiments, and cinematic gloom, Ulver have treated reinvention as a core philosophy rather than a marketing angle. *Neverland* already feels positioned as another chapter in that refusal to repeat themselves — music for listeners who prefer tension over hooks.

Releasing digitally at the very edge of the year feels intentional, almost defiant. No hype cycle bloat. No festival-season alignment. Just new music dropped into the void, waiting for the right ears to find it. Ulver don’t chase trends. They let time catch up to them instead.

## Bilmuri split with touring guitarist Reese Maslen following abuse allegations

[Bilmuri](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/bilmuri/) have parted ways with touring guitarist Reese Maslen following serious abuse allegations, making the split immediate. The band’s statement was brief and direct, leaving little room for ambiguity. In a scene that’s spent years learning — sometimes the hard way — how to respond to these situations, the move was swift and decisive.

There’s no spectacle here, and there doesn’t need to be. Abuse allegations don’t require fan debates, conspiracy threads, or performative outrage. They require action. Bilmuri made theirs clear, prioritizing distance and accountability over damage control or silence. That shouldn’t be notable — but history says it still is.

For fans, it’s another uncomfortable reminder that talent doesn’t exist in a vacuum, and being part of a band doesn’t grant immunity from consequences. The hope is that moments like this slowly shift expectations across the scene. Less tolerance. Less enabling. Less pretending it’s someone else’s problem.
