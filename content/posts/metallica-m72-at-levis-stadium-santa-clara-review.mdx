In their Bay Area “hometown” stronghold of Santa Clara, [Metallica’s M72 World Tour](https://www.metallica.com/tour) presented a colossal “No Repeat Weekend” across “two epic nights” at Levi’s Stadium — a weekend that wasn’t just a concert, but a metal pilgrimage. Over June 20 and June 22, 2025, the four-decade juggernaut delivered performances that pushed the boundaries of what a stadium show can feel like, all while honoring their roots, catalog deep cuts, and the loyal, generational crowd that has sustained them for nearly 45 years.

### Night 1 — Historic Opening, Vast Setlist & Raw Power

The first night of Metallica’s Santa Clara takeover was a ferocious declaration of intent. Before the headliners, the stage was warmed up by two very different acts that helped shape the heavy music landscape. First, Ice Nine Kills brought theatrical metalcore with slasher-film flair — a visually intense, horror-themed performance that grabbed attention and set an electrified tone for the evening. Their combination of narrative theatrics and melodic brutality woke the stadium early and teased just how varied this weekend would be.

Following them, Limp Bizkit injected a jolt of late-90s nu-metal nostalgia. Fred Durst and Wes Borland commanded a crowd not normally aligned with their genre with unapologetic swagger, remixing rap rock swagger with crowd incitement. By the time Bizkit wrapped with high-energy classics, the stadium was livid with anticipation — not just for Metallica, but for a full weekend of diverse heavy music experiences.

When [Metallica](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/metallica/) hit the stage, the Levi’s crowd responded like the roof had been blown off. From the first thunderous strikes of “Creeping Death,” the band unleashed a setlist that ranged from early thrash anthems to newer material. The band’s 360° central stage created a rare intimacy for a stadium production, allowing the group to connect with fans on all sides — and for fans to feel engulfed in the soundwaves of history.

Night 1 was packed with classics like “Harvester of Sorrow,” “Hit the Lights,” and “Battery,” alongside newer tracks such as “72 Seasons” and “If Darkness Had a Son.” There was also a rare tribute moment during “Orion,” a fan favorite instrumental that paid homage to one of the band’s fallen heroes. From the atmospheric acoustics of “Nothing Else Matters” to the blistering group chants of “Seek & Destroy,” the vibe was electric and unrelenting.

The finale was nothing short of cinematic: a thunderous run into “Fuel,” big-room sing-alongs, and the iconic closing might of “Master of Puppets,” leaving a crowd exhausted, exhilarated, and already hungry for Night 2.

### Night 2 — Deep Cuts, Bay Area Homage & Unforgettable Moments

If Night 1 was thunder, Night 2 was lightning. The opener lineup on the Sunday was a perfect complement, kicking off with veteran crossover thrashers Suicidal Tendencies. They brought fierce energy and raw Old School attitude, snarling their way through hardcore anthems and firing up pits that made it clear this would be no laid-back Sunday.

The featured support act was [Pantera](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/pantera/) — a groove metal icon returning in tribute form with members giving fierce renditions of classics and honoring the legacy of Dimebag Darrell and Vinnie Paul. Their performance turned into a moment of communal reverence and carnage, throwing a spotlight (and massive pits) on the deeper well of heavy music influence that shaped a generation.

Metallica’s own setlist on Night 2 was a lesson in dynamics and scope. They hit hard out of the gate with thrash staples like “Whiplash” and “For Whom the Bell Tolls,” building into atmospheric mid-set highlights like “The Memory Remains.” Newer songs — including “Lux Æterna” and “Screaming Suicide” — blended effortlessly with classics, reflecting both the band’s evolution and continued relevance.

A standout moment came from the playful “Kirk & Rob Doodle” where snippets of unexpected covers teased the crowd, paying homage to the region and punk roots alike — a cheeky Bay Area nod that became an instant conversation point. More heartfelt were the layered tributes scattered throughout the set: somber instrumental passages and renditions that honored legacy and lineage.

Night 2 delivered emotional climaxes with the pummeling drama of “The Unforgiven,” the rollicking sing-along of “Whiskey in the Jar,” and pulse-pounding intensity from “Blackened” and “Moth Into Flame.” The penultimate moment — a towering performance of “One” — brought the house down before the final, festival-defining sing-through of “Enter Sandman,” which reverberated through the stadium like an anthem for a generation.

### Highlights & Weekend Takeaways

What made this “No Repeat Weekend” more than just two shows were the combination of [distinct setlists](https://www.setlist.fm/search?query=metallica+santa+clara), powerful opening acts, artistic range, and the palpable hometown pride. Across both nights, Metallica traversed the breadth of their career — from early thrash and cult deep cuts, through emotional balladry, to contemporary anthems — without repeating a single song between the evenings.

The production was immense yet considerate — the 360° stage design and immersive lighting kept every seat in the house feeling close to the action. Meanwhile, the crowd’s energy — tens of thousands of fans who queued hours early, sang every line, and revived the sense of community in live heavy music — made the whole experience unforgettable.

For the Bay Area, this wasn’t just a Metallica tour stop. It was a homecoming celebration, a historical marker, and a reminder that even after decades at the top of the metal world, Metallica can still deliver shows that feel vital, personal, and wildly euphoric.
