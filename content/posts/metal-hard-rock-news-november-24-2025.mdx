The metal world is buzzing again this week, and today’s **metal news** recap brings major lineup shifts, massive tour reveals, and a wave of heavy new releases across the scene. November has already proven to be one of the busiest months of 2025 for metal and hard rock fans, and this latest round of updates only intensifies the momentum. Catch more in the [latest Rundown](https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/).

## **Today’s Metal News: Alissa White-Gluz Leaves Arch Enemy After 11 Years**

🎤 In one of the most talked-about stories in recent **metal news**, Alissa White-Gluz has officially parted ways with *Arch Enemy* after more than a decade fronting the band. Her powerful vocals and commanding stage presence helped define the band’s modern era, shaping three studio albums, multiple world tours, and a new generation of fans.

Alongside her departure, Alissa released a hauntingly cinematic solo single titled *“The Room Where She Died.”* The song leans into a darker, more dramatic atmosphere with orchestral layers, clean-vocal passages, and some of her most emotional lyric work to date.

Fans immediately questioned whether this marks the start of a full-scale solo era — and based on the single’s reception, that seems extremely likely. Conversations across social media suggest that many listeners felt the song reflects musical ideas she may not have been able to fully explore within Arch Enemy.

### **Who Will Replace Alissa?**

📣 As expected, speculation across the **metal news** community is exploding. No official announcement has been made regarding a new vocalist, which has left room for fan theories:

A return from a former Arch Enemy vocalist

A surprise choice from another well-known metal band

A complete newcomer from the underground scene

Until the band issues a formal statement, the mystery remains one of the biggest open questions in modern melodic death metal.

## **HEALTH Release Crushing New Single “SHRED ENVY”**

🎧 Industrial-metal innovators **HEALTH** have dropped one of their heaviest tracks ever: *“[SHRED ENVY.”](https://youtu.be/D3ApCSWCoVU?si=-1pEdpcWJ1qMjyX9)* The song blends the band’s signature electronic distortion, noise-rock aggression, and metallic intensity into a brutal, fully weaponized production that immediately captured attention across the heavy-music world.

The track’s official music video dives deep into industrial-horror aesthetics, featuring frantic energy and visual nods to *Chainsaw Man.* Fans have praised the direction as bold, violent, and refreshingly chaotic — exactly what HEALTH excels at.

### **HEALTH Announce 2026 North American Tour**

Alongside the single, the band confirmed a massive **2026 North American tour**, marking a major cycle for their next era. Early teasers hint at an expanded stage show, upgraded lighting rigs, and the band’s most intense setlist yet. With the success of *“SHRED ENVY”*, this tour is expected to be one of the standout industrial-metal events of the year.

## **Amon Amarth Expand Their 2026 “Allfather Awakens” Tour**

🛡️ Viking metal giants **Amon Amarth** have added several new dates to their upcoming 2026 UK/EU **“Allfather Awakens”** tour. New stops include London, Manchester, Antwerp, Lyon, and Warsaw. Known for their cinematic storytelling, massive pyro effects, and stadium-sized riffs, Amon Amarth continue their rise as one of Europe’s biggest heavy-music touring acts.

Their ability to merge melodic death metal with Norse mythology has kept them at the forefront of the scene, and this tour expansion proves just how strong the demand remains across Europe.

## **Heavy-Music Release Calendar: A Huge Week for Fans**

📅 This week’s updated heavy-music release calendar includes dozens of new albums and singles across black metal, metalcore, industrial, and hard rock. Several underground acts are dropping debut EPs, while veteran bands are releasing late-year singles before the 2026 cycle begins.

From atmospheric black metal and crushing deathcore to 80s-inspired hard-rock revival tracks, the variety makes this one of November’s most exciting release weeks. Fans looking to stay updated on all new releases can browse our **[New Releases](https://metal-mantra.com/new-releases/)** section

The final weeks of 2025 continue to deliver nonstop announcements, new music, and shifts in the heavy-music landscape. Between Alissa’s departure from Arch Enemy, HEALTH’s brutal return, and Amon Amarth’s expanded tour, this cycle has already set the stage for a massive year ahead.
