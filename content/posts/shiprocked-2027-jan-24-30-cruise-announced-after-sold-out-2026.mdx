ShipRocked isn’t just a lineup on a boat — it’s a week where the usual “see you next tour” distance disappears. You’re watching bands rip a deck stage with the ocean behind them, then you’re bumping into the same artists at breakfast, catching surprise sets, and ending up in conversations with people who flew in from everywhere for the same reason: they want their live music loud, close, and actually *fun* again.

**Booking Snapshot:** Dates: Jan 24–30, 2027 | Departure: Miami | Route: Mahogany Bay + Cozumel | [Get presale access now](https://www.shiprocked.com/presale). **Cabins go fast.**

After a **sold-out** 2026 sailing with **over 4,100 guests** (the biggest ShipRocked yet), producer ASK4 Entertainment has set the 2027 route: **January 24–30, 2027**, departing **Miami** aboard **Carnival Horizon**, with stops at **Mahogany Bay (Roatan, Honduras)** — a first-time ShipRocked port — and **Cozumel, Mexico**. If you’ve been on the fence, this is the kind of trip that makes sense the second you stop thinking of it as a cruise and start thinking of it as a roaming festival where your hotel follows you.

The theme for the next one is “**ShipRocked Samurai**.” Naturally.

## ShipRocked 2026: biggest year yet (and a $200K charity auction)

ShipRocked 2026 ran January 25–31 and turned Carnival Horizon into a full-on roaming festival, sailing from Miami to Half Moon Cay, Celebration Key (Carnival’s newly opened private port on Grand Bahama), and Nassau. The lineup was stacked: **Halestorm**, **Motionless In White**, **Knocked Loose**, **Wage War**, **AWOLNATION**, **Suicidal Tendencies**, **Avatar**, **Starset**, **Sleep Theory**, **From Ashes To New**, **Kittie**, and more than 30 bands total.

One of the cooler notes: the onboard “**Cancer Sucks!**” charity auction reportedly raised **$200,000**. That’s not pocket change — that’s real impact.

Metal Mantra will keep an eye on the 2027 band lineup announcement — because once that drop hits, cabins go fast and the “I’ll decide later” crowd gets left behind.
