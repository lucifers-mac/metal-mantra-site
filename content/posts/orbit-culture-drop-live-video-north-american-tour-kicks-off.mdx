Orbit Culture just dropped a live video for fan favorite “The Storm” — and it’s not just a clip for the algorithm. It’s a document of the band’s last headline run, shot with a heavy focus on Gothenburg (close to home) and built to capture what their shows actually feel like when everything locks into place.

According to the band, the video pulls them right back to a night that “carried real weight — intense, focused, and honest.” That’s the point: no narrative gymnastics, no extra mythology layered on top. Just a performance that hits hard, filmed like it matters.

The timing isn’t accidental. The band is about to kick off a North American run with Ov Sulfur and Atlas starting Feb. 18, and this is a clean way to remind people what they’re walking into. Orbit Culture have always lived in that space where groove and brutality shake hands — riffs that hit like modern thrash and death metal, with an industrial edge that keeps it moving even when the guitars are trying to crush everything in the room.

“The Storm” is also another visual chapter tied to *Death Above Life*, the album the band released last October. If you missed that record the first time around, this is the kind of clip that makes the sell without sounding like a sales pitch. **Buy:** [Death Above Life (Orbit Culture) on Amazon](https://amzn.to/4qGmvcy). The band has described *Death Above Life* as a change and a reset — guitarist/vocalist/songwriter Niklas Karlsson called it “a big change for the better” and framed it as a rebirth. That’s dramatic language, sure, but the bigger point is simple: Orbit Culture aren’t playing it safe or recycling an older version of themselves. They’re trying to level up.

If you’re a riffs-first listener, that’s why this band keeps grabbing attention. They’re heavy, but they’re not lazy. There are hooks, there’s pacing, and there’s a sense that the band actually cares about dynamics instead of just maxing out distortion and calling it “crushing.”
