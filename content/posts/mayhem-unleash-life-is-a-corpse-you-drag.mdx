Mayhem are back, and they’re not here to comfort anyone. The Norwegian black metal lifers have dropped a new video for **“Life Is a Corpse You Drag”**, the latest cut from their upcoming album *Liturgy of Death*, due out February 6. If you were hoping for nostalgia, irony, or anything resembling mercy, look elsewhere. This is Mayhem doing what they’ve always done best: staring straight into the void and daring it to blink first.

*Liturgy of Death* marks the band’s seventh full-length and lands with the weight of four decades of scars, controversy, and survival behind it. Mortality isn’t treated like a poetic metaphor here — it’s a law. An unavoidable one. Mayhem frame death not as an ending, but as the constant pressure shaping every breath before it. It’s bleak, sure, but it’s also brutally honest. And honesty has always been their sharpest weapon.

Attila doesn’t sugarcoat it either. Speaking on the new track, he describes it as “not a slogan, but a ritual and a realization,” reducing consciousness to burden and the body to a temporary vessel already marked for the grave. There’s no self-help nonsense hiding in the margins. The message is simple and cold: if we’ve been dead all along, fear loses its power. That’s not comforting — it’s liberating in the most violent way possible.

This lineup — Necrobutcher, Hellhammer, Attila, Ghul, and Morten Bergeton Iversen — sounds locked in and vicious. No frills. No polish for the sake of accessibility. Just dark, fast, unrelenting black metal that feels alive because it refuses to pretend otherwise. Forty-one years in, Mayhem still sound dangerous, and that alone puts them miles ahead of bands half their age.

[Black metal](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/black-metal/) was never meant to age gracefully. The fact that Mayhem are still here — still hostile, still uncompromising — feels almost unnatural. That’s exactly why it works.
