Florida metalcore outfit Wage War have announced a new EP, *It Calls Me By Name*, due April 17 via Fearless Records. The five-track record is rooted hard in the band’s home state — described by the group as “shaped by Florida, the swamp, and the relentless aggression of nature.” If the lead single is any indication, this is the heaviest thing they’ve committed to tape.

Alongside the announcement, Wage War dropped the video for “Song of the Swamp,” a track built on bloodthirsty screams, dense riffage, and percussion designed to make you feel like a speedbag. The band’s framing is simple: “The tone setter. Rooted in where we’re from. Driven by Florida and the raw aggression of nature.” It’s a hard turn toward straight metal, and it lands.

The full EP tracklist is: “Song of the Swamp,” “4×4,” “Blindfold,” “Karma,” and “Purify.” The band says the collection isn’t a concept record but “is meant to live in its own world.” Pre-orders are open now via Fearless Records. Wage War joins a packed wave of [2026’s strongest touring metalcore acts](https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-metal-tours-coming-in-2026/), including names that have already staked out major runs across the year.

To support the release, Wage War will headline the “It Calls Me By Name Tour” with Nevertel and Orthodox in support — a 21-date run kicking off April 28 in Phoenix and closing May 31 in St. Petersburg, FL. The tour cuts through San Francisco, Chicago, New York, and Atlanta before ending on home turf. Given what “Song of the Swamp” sounds like at full volume, these rooms are going to be loud.
