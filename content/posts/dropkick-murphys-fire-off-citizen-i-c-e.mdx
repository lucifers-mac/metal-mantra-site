Dropkick Murphys are doing what they’ve always done best: taking the piss out of power, turning it into a chant, and daring you to sing it louder than the people in charge want to hear it. The band just dropped a new track, “**Citizen I.C.E.**,” a late-2025 rework of their 2005 cut “Citizen C.I.A.” — and they’re framing it as a direct response to what they called “Americans being executed in the street.” It’s blunt, ugly, and necessary.

Along with the single, Dropkick Murphys are rolling out *New England Forever*, a 12” split LP with tourmates **Haywire**. Both bands contributed three originals and swapped covers — Haywire takes on Dropkick’s “The Boys Are Back,” and Dropkick returns the favor with Haywire’s “Always By My Side.” The physical vinyl is slated to be **available exclusively at shows** on the band’s *For The People…In The Pit* St. Patrick’s Day Tour.

## Boston hometown shows: full support lineups announced

As the tour wraps, Dropkick Murphys’ annual St. Patrick’s Day week takeover in Boston is once again stacked — and it doubles as a **30th birthday celebration** for the band. Here’s the full rundown of the hometown shows and support acts:

**Fri, March 13** — MGM Music Hall at Fenway — Dropkick Murphys, **Showcase Showdown**, **Haywire** & **Vigilantes**

**Sat, March 14 (2:00 PM)** — MGM Music Hall at Fenway — Charity mini-concert (Dropkick Murphys)

**Sat, March 14 (night)** — MGM Music Hall at Fenway — Dropkick Murphys, **Haywire** & **The Aggrolites** (**SOLD OUT**)

**Sun, March 15** — MGM Music Hall at Fenway — Dropkick Murphys, **Unseen**, **Ducky Boys** & **Haywire**

**Tue, March 17** — Citizens House of Blues — Dropkick Murphys, **The New Darkbuster**, **Reducers S.F.** & **Big Bad Bollocks** (**SOLD OUT**)

The run is the final stretch of the *For The People…In The Pit* U.S. tour (kicking off Feb. 9), with The Aggrolites and Haywire supporting on most dates — and the Boston weekend built as its own little scene reunion, pulling in hometown punk and street-level lifers alongside the usual globe-trotting DKM faithful.

*Metal Mantra note:* whatever you think about “politics in punk,” Dropkick Murphys have been telling you exactly who they are for decades. “Citizen I.C.E.” isn’t subtle — it’s not trying to be — and that’s the whole point.
