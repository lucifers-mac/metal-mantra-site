**Presale heads up:** The Hu and Apocalyptica just announced a Spring 2026 co-headline run, and the presale codes are already out in the open. The Hu’s presale code is **THEHUN**, and Apocalyptica’s is **CELLOS**.

The tour kicks off May 12 in Silver Spring, MD and wraps June 7 in Anaheim, CA, with support from Finnish rock vets The Rasmus on all dates. Public on-sale starts Friday, February 13 at 10am local time.

Tickets + VIP info:

• The Hu: [thehuofficial.com](http://thehuofficial.com) (presale code **THEHUN**)

• Apocalyptica: [apocalyptica.com](http://apocalyptica.com) (presale code **CELLOS**)

The Hu are also coming off the release of their recent single “The Real You,” which they’ve framed as a statement piece for the next chapter (“The Hun”). Apocalyptica, meanwhile, continue to do what they’ve done for decades: take the weight of metal and run it through a classical instrument that somehow makes it feel even heavier. (If you’ve caught them live, you already know.)
