Former **I Prevail** vocalist **Brian Burkheiser** has officially re-entered the heavy-music world with the launch of his new project,
[**Scatterbrain**](https://scatterbrain.com/), debuting with a dark, dynamic cover of Taylor Swift’s hit single
**“Look What You Made Me Do.”** The Scatterbrain Taylor Swift cover marks Burkheiser’s first publicly released
music since exiting I Prevail earlier this year and signals the beginning of a new chapter built on reinvention,
resilience, and creative freedom. More reviews: [Review hub](https://metal-mantra.com/review/).
## From I Prevail to Scatterbrain: A New Era for Brian Burkheiser

For roughly a decade, Brian Burkheiser helped define **I Prevail**’s sound as the band’s clean vocalist, blending
soaring melodies with crushing metalcore arrangements. The band rose quickly from viral fame to festival main stages,
earning gold-certified singles and even a Grammy nomination along the way. When I Prevail announced earlier this year that
they had “mutually parted ways” with Burkheiser, it closed a major chapter for both the singer and the band.

After the split, Burkheiser addressed fans directly to clarify that personal and family factors played a role in his
departure and that there was no bad blood despite online speculation. What followed was a stretch of relative quiet:
teasers, cryptic posts, and hints that he was working on something new under a different name.

That name is **Scatterbrain** — a project that allows Burkheiser to step outside the confines of genre and
expectation. While I Prevail continues forward with new music and touring plans, Scatterbrain represents a clean slate,
and the Taylor Swift cover is the first official statement of intent.
## Legal Roadblocks, Delays, and the Drive to Create

The road to Scatterbrain’s debut hasn’t been simple. In late summer, Burkheiser revealed that an unresolved dispute
connected to his former band was preventing him from releasing new original music, including a song titled
*“Phases.”* For fans who had been eagerly waiting to hear what Brian Burkheiser would sound like outside of
I Prevail, it was a frustrating development.

Instead of going silent, Burkheiser decided to pivot. If original material needed to wait, he would find another path
to reconnect with listeners. That path became this Scatterbrain Taylor Swift cover — a way to share something that felt
emotionally honest, creatively exciting, and symbolically important without adding more fuel to any legal complications.
## The Scatterbrain Taylor Swift Cover: “Look What You Made Me Do” Reimagined

The new Scatterbrain release reimagines Taylor Swift’s **“Look What You Made Me Do”** as a tense,
cinematic, alt-rock and metal-infused track. Where the original leans into sly pop minimalism and dark swagger,
Scatterbrain pushes the song toward a more dramatic, guitar-forward, and emotionally charged space.

The choice of song isn’t accidental. “Look What You Made Me Do” is a track about reclaiming narrative, shedding past
versions of yourself, and standing firm in a new identity — themes that mirror where Brian Burkheiser is in his career.
It’s both a musical statement and a personal one, aligning perfectly with the launch of Scatterbrain.
## Official Statement: Brian Burkheiser on Scatterbrain and His First Release

Alongside the release, Burkheiser shared a heartfelt message to fans as part of the official Scatterbrain press announcement:

**“To my fans:**

This year forced me to pivot in ways I never expected, and it tested me more than I can explain.
But through it all, your support has meant everything.

I’m excited to finally share a song with you. I chose this cover because it truly resonates with me
and serves as a nod to what first sparked my career.

I’m still working toward the day I can release my original music, but for now, I’m grateful to have
found a way to put a piece of art into the world.

The statement underlines just how personal this release is. The Scatterbrain project isn’t a casual side quest; it’s
the vehicle for Burkheiser’s creative rebirth, forged during one of the most challenging years of his life.
## What Scatterbrain Means for Fans of I Prevail and Modern Metal

For fans who discovered Brian Burkheiser through I Prevail’s blend of metalcore, post-hardcore, and modern rock,
Scatterbrain offers a familiar emotional weight in a new package. Early descriptions of the project emphasize a fusion
of rock, hip-hop, pop, electronic elements, and everything in between — a genre-fluid approach that mirrors how many
heavy-music listeners consume music today.

While I Prevail moves ahead with their own evolution, Scatterbrain allows Burkheiser to explore more experimental,
personal, and stylistically diverse material. The Taylor Swift cover feels like a mission statement:
he’s not interested in repeating his past — he’s interested in transforming it.
## What’s Next for Scatterbrain?

The big question now is what comes after this Taylor Swift cover. Fans are still anticipating the official release of
original Scatterbrain songs like *“Phases,”* which were delayed by earlier disputes. Burkheiser has been open
about wanting to share that material as soon as he can.

In the meantime, Scatterbrain’s debut sends a clear message: Brian Burkheiser is not quietly slipping away from the
scene. He’s stepping back into it with a sharpened focus, a new sound, and a project built entirely on his own terms.
Whether the next chapter brings more covers, original singles, or a full album, Scatterbrain is now officially in play
— and the heavy-music world will be watching.
