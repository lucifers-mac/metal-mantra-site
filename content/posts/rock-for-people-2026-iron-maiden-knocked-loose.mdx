**Rock for People** just loaded up their special [Iron Maiden](/tag/iron-maiden/) day with enough firepower to justify the hype. [Knocked Loose](/tag/knocked-loose/), **Saxon**, **Alexisonfire**, and **Man With A Mission** are all confirmed for Sunday, June 14, 2026 — the fifth and final day of the [Czech festival](https://metal-mantra.com/rock-for-people-2026-announces-massive-lineup-featuring-iron-maiden-bring-me-the-horizon-papa-roach-electric-callboy-2/) that’s become one of Europe’s better-curated hard music gatherings at Park 360 in Hradec Králové. We’ll keep updates rolling in our [Rock for People 2026 coverage](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/rock-for-people-2026/).

[Buy Rock for People 2026 passes now](https://rockforpeople.cz/en/tickets/) (capacity is moving fast).

This isn’t just padding around a headliner. Saxon brings legitimate NWOBHM pedigree — these guys were charting when most of us weren’t born, with classics like “Wheels of Steel” and “Denim and Leather” defining early 80s metal. If you want to revisit the classics before the festival, grab [Saxon’s Wheels of Steel](https://amzn.to/3NXPkDS) on vinyl. Their 50-year career proves they’ve earned their spot on any bill with Maiden.

Knocked Loose represents everything heavy that matters right now. That Grammy nomination for Best Metal Performance proved hardcore finally broke through the mainstream’s bullshit gate, and their chaotic live shows have been obliterating festivals worldwide. We just covered their absolute destruction at ShipRocked 2026, where they turned the cruise into a floating mosh pit — [read our full cruise review here](https://metal-mantra.com/shiprocked-2026-review-metal-cruise-dead-poet-society-knocked-loose/) to see what Rock for People is in for.

Alexisonfire brings that mid-2000s post-hardcore energy that still resonates. The Canadian quintet’s combination of screamo intensity and melodic hooks influenced an entire generation of bands, and their recent reunion shows they haven’t lost a step. Man With A Mission rounds out the bill with their anime-inspired rock theatrics — they’re genuinely fun in a scene that takes itself too seriously sometimes, and their return after Rock for People 2023 shows the festival knows what works.

Festival director Luděk Motyčka says they built a “dramaturgically thought-out day” — which is just fancy talk for saying they actually gave a shit about booking bands that make sense together. It shows. You’re getting metal legends alongside the bands reshaping heavy music in 2026, all building toward Maiden’s inevitable two-hour assault.

## The Iron Maiden Day Caps a Stacked Five-Day Festival

The Maiden-anchored Sunday isn’t happening in a vacuum. Rock for People 2026 runs June 10-14 with one of the most eclectic lineups the Czech festival has ever assembled. Wednesday kicks off with **Gorillaz**, **Electric Callboy**, [Megadeth](/tag/megadeth/), and **Trivium**. Thursday brings [Limp Bizkit](/tag/limp-bizkit/), **Papa Roach**, and **BABYMETAL**. Friday sees [Bring Me The Horizon](/tag/bring-me-the-horizon/) headline alongside **A Day To Remember** and **Tom Morello**. Saturday closes with **Halsey**, **Within Temptation**, and **Nothing But Thieves**.

It’s the kind of booking strategy that works because they’re not trying to be Download or Wacken — Rock for People has always lived in the space where rock, metal, and alternative overlap without apology. The festival has built its reputation over two decades by taking chances on diverse lineups that somehow make perfect sense when you’re actually there. The Maiden day just takes that philosophy and dials it to eleven with a focused heavy music lineup that actually respects the headliner’s legacy instead of throwing random acts on the bill.

## Grandstands, Beer, and Selling Out Fast

[Rock for People](https://rockforpeople.cz/en) is adding seated grandstands at the main stage for 490 CZK (about $21 USD) as a ticket upgrade to any festival pass. Not a bad call if you want guaranteed sightlines for Maiden’s two-hour set without fighting for barrier position all day. The grandstand setup is new for 2026, addressing one of the few complaints about the festival’s otherwise excellent facilities at Park 360.

Want to prep for the show? [Pick up some Iron Maiden vinyl](https://amzn.to/46AqBf3) before you head to Prague. Die-hards can also hit up an Iron Maiden Trooper beer tasting and special wine experience, because apparently Bruce Dickinson’s beverage empire is taking over the festival grounds. Honestly, if you’re going to get hammered at a metal festival, might as well do it with the headliner’s branded alcohol.

**Tickets are moving fast** — over 80% of capacity is already gone, which is unusual for February. The Iron Maiden announcement clearly lit a fire under ticket sales. If you’re planning to make the trip to Park 360 in Hradec Králové, Czechia, grab tickets [directly from Rock for People](https://rockforpeople.cz/en/tickets/) before this thing sells out completely. Multi-day passes start around $345, with single-day tickets for the Iron Maiden Sunday expected to be announced soon.
