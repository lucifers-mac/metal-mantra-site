After nearly two decades without a full-length studio album, Swedish heavy metal mainstays **LION&#8217;S SHARE** are finally ready to step back into the spotlight. Their new record, *Inferno*, arrives **March 27, 2026**, through **Metalville Records**, and marks a major milestone for a band whose influence stretches across the European metal scene and far beyond. More metal news: [News hub](https://metal-mantra.com/news/).

Fans of traditional heavy metal, melodic power metal, and the classic Swedish steel sound have been waiting a long time for this moment — and *Inferno* is shaping up to be the kind of focused, heavy, and revitalized comeback few bands ever achieve.
## A Return Fueled by Fire, Focus, and Purpose

Founding guitarist **Lars Chriss** explains the mindset behind the band’s long-awaited return:

“For us, *Inferno* is more than just a new album — it’s a statement. We’ve spent years writing, refining, and pushing ourselves harder than ever. The goal was simple: make the strongest, heaviest, and most focused LION&#8217;S SHARE record of our career. I honestly feel we’ve achieved that.”

Vocalist **Nils Patrik Johansson**, whose unmistakable voice has become one of the band’s defining elements, echoes the sentiment:

“Taking 17 years between albums wasn’t the plan — but it gave us time to reset, rebuild, and come back with absolute purpose. We’ve never sounded tighter, and we can’t wait to bring these songs to the stage. This record has everything we love about heavy metal — attitude, hooks, power. We’re incredibly proud of it.”

Their words capture the spirit of the new era: not a nostalgic reunion, but a sharpened, battle-ready LION&#8217;S SHARE stepping confidently into the present.
## A Legacy Rooted in Swedish Heavy Metal History

LION&#8217;S SHARE began in **Sundsvall, Sweden**, in 1987 — a time when Scandinavian metal was evolving rapidly, blending traditional heavy metal with emerging melodic and power metal influences. Guitarist **Lars Chriss** and keyboardist **Kay Backlund** formed the core of what would become one of Sweden’s most respected underground acts.

The band’s early years were marked by relentless rehearsals, bold songwriting, and a live presence powerful enough to earn them coveted touring spots with some of the biggest names in heavy music:

Motörhead
Saxon
Dio
Manowar
U.D.O.
Dee Snider

These weren’t casual opportunities — they were earned through raw energy, precision musicianship, and a sound that resonated with fans of classic heavy metal around the world.

Over the years, LION&#8217;S SHARE collaborated with musicians connected to **KISS**, **Megadeth**, **King Diamond**, **Candlemass**, **Symphony X**, and **Yngwie Malmsteen**, further solidifying their status as a respected force in the international metal community.

Albums like *Emotional Coma* (2007) and *Dark Hours* (2009) helped cement their reputation for blending aggressive riffing with melodic hooks, something that carries forward into *Inferno* with renewed intensity.
## The New Era: *Inferno* (2026)

Today, LION&#8217;S SHARE operates as a tight, creative partnership between **Chriss** and **Johansson**, supported by trusted musicians in both the studio and on the road. This streamlined approach has allowed the band to refine their sound and focus entirely on songwriting, production quality, and capturing the essence of what makes LION&#8217;S SHARE distinct.

*Inferno* delivers exactly what its title suggests — a blazing, intense, and meticulously crafted heavy metal album that reflects decades of experience while still sounding fresh and current.
