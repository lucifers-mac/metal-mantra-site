Swedish melodic death metal titans [Amon Amarth](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/amon-amarth/) and animated cult phenomenon [Dethklok](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/dethklok/) have officially joined forces for one of the most anticipated metal tours of 2026, unveiling a co-headlining North American run that merges Viking brutality with animated extreme metal spectacle. The tour, appropriately titled **The Amonklok Conquest**, will also feature rising doom metal outfit [Castle Rat](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/castle-rat/) as support, creating a lineup that blends legacy, theatricality, and underground momentum into a single night of heavy metal excess. Tickets and tour roundups live on our [Tours & Tickets hub](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/).

The Amonklok Conquest kicks off April 15, 2026 in Phoenix, Arizona at the Arizona Financial Theatre and storms across the continent before concluding May 21, 2026 in Las Vegas at PH Live at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino. Along the way, the tour will hit major markets including San Antonio, Houston, Oklahoma City, Kansas City, Minneapolis, Brooklyn, Boston, Toronto, Montreal, Atlanta, Nashville, Detroit, Denver, and Salt Lake City, delivering a full-scale production designed to satisfy fans of both crushing metal riffs and immersive stagecraft.

Amon Amarth continue to stand as one of modern metal’s most consistent live forces, bringing their battle-ready anthems and Viking-themed visuals to stages worldwide. Known for albums like *Twilight of the Thunder God* and their more recent release *[The Great Heathen Army](https://amzn.to/4rZ921v)*, the band has built a career on combining melodic death metal ferocity with epic storytelling. Their live shows are equal parts concert and cinematic experience, often featuring towering stage props, synchronized lighting, and a relentless setlist built for mass chanting and raised horns.

Dethklok’s presence on the tour adds a different kind of spectacle altogether. Born from Adult Swim’s *Metalocalypse*, the fictional band has long since transcended animation, evolving into a legitimate touring act led by creator and multi-instrumentalist Brendon Small. With the recent release of *[Dethalbum IV](https://amzn.to/3XYuhCL)*, Dethklok’s live performances now merge high-definition animation, synchronized video elements, and crushing extreme metal into a show that feels both absurd and brutally precise. The Amonklok Conquest represents one of the largest touring platforms Dethklok has ever undertaken, cementing their place as more than a novelty act.

Tickets for The Amonklok Conquest go on sale to the general public Friday, December 12 at 10 a.m. local time via [Ticketmaster](https://www.ticketmaster.com), with artist presales and select venue presales available in advance. VIP packages and exclusive merchandise bundles are also expected to be offered, giving fans early access, limited collectibles, and premium experiences. Fans are encouraged to act quickly, as early demand suggests many dates could sell out rapidly.

Opening each night, Castle Rat brings a distinctly different flavor to the lineup. The New York-based band has been steadily building momentum within the underground doom and heavy rock scene, thanks to their theatrical medieval aesthetic and riff-driven storytelling. Fronted by the commanding presence of the “Rat Queen,” Castle Rat’s music draws from classic doom metal, heavy rock, and fantasy imagery, creating a live experience that feels both mythic and menacing. Their 2025 release *[The Bestiary](https://amzn.to/4qaLvJd)* has helped propel them onto larger stages, and this tour marks their most high-profile exposure yet.

The Amonklok Conquest stands as more than just a tour announcement — it’s a statement about metal’s ability to evolve while honoring its roots. By pairing Amon Amarth’s time-tested Viking metal assault with Dethklok’s multimedia chaos and Castle Rat’s rising underground mystique, the tour captures multiple eras and aesthetics of heavy music under one banner. For fans of spectacle, riffs, and unapologetic metal theatrics, this is shaping up to be one of 2026’s must-see tours.
