Breaking Benjamin have announced a 30-date North American tour for fall 2026, running September 2 through October 24. Chevelle, Starset, and Kami Kehoe will support. Produced by Live Nation, it’s an amphitheater and arena run that opens at Freedom Mortgage Pavilion in Camden, NJ and closes at Jiffy Lube Live in Bristow, VA — with major stops in Denver, Las Vegas, Anaheim, and Fort Worth in between.

The band recently signed to BMG and dropped “Awaken,” their first new music in five years. It’s a direct statement of intent: Breaking Benjamin are not coasting on catalog. With ten number-one Active Rock singles and more than 8.5 billion combined streams worldwide, they have the history to fill rooms this size without a new album — but “Awaken” signals there’s more coming. The last studio full-length, *Aurora*, dropped in 2020 alongside the acoustic companion *Ember* (2018), which debuted at number three on the Billboard 200.

Chevelle on the support slot is the right call — two bands with compatible audiences and enough muscle to hold a room independently. Starset bring a different texture, more atmospheric and theatrical, which gives the run some range on the undercard. This lands among the bigger hard rock tours of the fall, alongside [the strongest 2026 touring packages already announced](https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-metal-tours-coming-in-2026/).
