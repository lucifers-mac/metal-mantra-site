Breaking Benjamin have announced a 30-date North American tour for fall 2026, running September 2 through October 24. Chevelle, Starset, and Kami Kehoe will support. Produced by Live Nation, it&#8217;s an amphitheater and arena run that opens at Freedom Mortgage Pavilion in Camden, NJ and closes at Jiffy Lube Live in Bristow, VA — with major stops in Denver, Las Vegas, Anaheim, and Fort Worth in between.

The band recently signed to BMG and dropped &#8220;Awaken,&#8221; their first new music in five years. It&#8217;s a direct statement of intent: Breaking Benjamin are not coasting on catalog. With ten number-one Active Rock singles and more than 8.5 billion combined streams worldwide, they have the history to fill rooms this size without a new album — but &#8220;Awaken&#8221; signals there&#8217;s more coming. The last studio full-length, *Aurora*, dropped in 2020 alongside the acoustic companion *Ember* (2018), which debuted at number three on the Billboard 200.

Chevelle on the support slot is the right call — two bands with compatible audiences and enough muscle to hold a room independently. Starset bring a different texture, more atmospheric and theatrical, which gives the run some range on the undercard. This lands among the bigger hard rock tours of the fall, alongside [the strongest 2026 touring packages already announced](https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-metal-tours-coming-in-2026/).
