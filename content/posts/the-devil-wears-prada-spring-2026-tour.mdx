The Devil Wears Prada have never been a nostalgia act—but they’re also not afraid to look the past dead in the eye and laugh at it. Today, the band officially unleashed **“Play The Old Shit”**, a previously vinyl-only secret track tucked away at the end of the *Flowers* LP. Fans found it. Fans demanded it. TDWP listened. Tickets and tour roundups live on our [Tours & Tickets hub](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/).

Now it’s live on streaming services, loud and unapologetic. [Listen here](https://tdwp.ffm.to/oldshit), or watch the official visualizer below. No marketing fluff. No mystery left unsolved. Just a blunt, straightforward track that hits different precisely because it wasn’t meant to be front-and-center.

Frontman **Mike Hranica** summed it up best: the band has never really messed with secret songs before, but once the vinyl-only experiment ran its course, it was always coming to digital. Within the context of *Flowers*, the track flips the emotional switch at the very end. It’s not subtle—and that’s the point.

Let’s be clear: *Flowers* isn’t a victory lap album. It’s a band 20 years deep still pushing forward instead of recycling riffs for easy applause. If you’ve followed TDWP from *With Roots Above and Branches Below* through *Color Decay*, this secret track feels like a knowing smirk from a band that’s earned the right to mess with expectations.

If you somehow still don’t own the record, you can grab *Flowers* here: [Amazon](https://amzn.to/3LIgf5D). Vinyl heads already know why it matters.

## Spring 2026 Tour: No Breaks, No Mercy

As if the song drop wasn’t enough, TDWP are rolling straight into a full Spring 2026 headline tour. After a 2025 run that took them from Warped Tour Orlando to South Africa, Australia, and across Europe, the band clearly has no interest in slowing down.

The tour kicks off March 13 in Oklahoma City and runs through April 12 in Nashville, with support from **Four Year Strong**, **Split Chain**, and **I Promised The World**. That’s not a soft lineup. That’s controlled chaos by design.

[Tickets are on sale now](https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fthe-devil-wears-prada-tickets%2Fartist%2F1278537). If you’ve seen TDWP live recently, you already know they’re sharper, heavier, and more locked-in than ever. If you haven’t—fix that.

The Devil Wears Prada have built their reputation on consistency, and their live show is a big reason why they’ve stayed relevant for two decades. Whether it’s club runs or major festival slots, TDWP don’t phone it in—and this Spring 2026 tour reads like another reminder that they’re still one of metalcore’s most reliable live bands.

Between a surprise song release, a relentless touring schedule, and an album that refuses to play it safe, The Devil Wears Prada aren’t chasing their legacy—they’re actively trying to outgrow it. Some bands age gracefully. Others stay dangerous. TDWP are clearly choosing the latter.
