**HRADEC KRÁLOVÉ, Czech Republic —** Rock for People, one of Europe’s premier rock and metal festivals, has officially unveiled the first wave of its **Rock for People 2026 lineup**, and it is nothing short of monumental. Leading the announcement are two global heavyweights: **Iron Maiden** and **Bring Me The Horizon**, joined by a powerhouse roster including **Papa Roach**, **Electric Callboy**, **Megadeth**, **The Pretty Reckless**, and more.

The festival will expand once again, running **five full days from June 10–14, 2026**, at **Park 360 in Hradec Králové**, reaffirming its status as one of the most ambitious and influential rock festivals in Europe.

## **Iron Maiden to Headline a Special Extra Day for Their 50th Anniversary**

In a historic moment for both the festival and metal fans worldwide, **Iron Maiden** will headline a **special added festival day on Sunday, June 14**, marking an exclusive celebration of the band’s **50 years on stage**.

This stop on their **Run For Your Lives World Tour (2023–2026)** will be among the **last opportunities to see Iron Maiden live before the band takes a break from touring in 2027**—a major draw for longtime fans.

With classics spanning decades, a stage production unlike anything else in heavy metal, and the legendary Eddie in full force, Iron Maiden’s appearance is being hailed as one of the most significant bookings in Rock for People history.

Festival founder **Michal Thomes** expressed both pride and disbelief at securing them:

“Rock for People 2026 will once again be marked by the fulfillment of some of my dreams, led by Iron Maiden, whose music has shaped several generations, including me.”

## **Bring Me The Horizon Returns as a Generation-Defining Headliner**

Modern heavy music juggernauts **Bring Me The Horizon** will headline on **June 12**, bringing their genre-shattering mix of metalcore, electronics, pop, and alternative rock back to the RFP stage after their unforgettable performance in 2024.

BMTH continue to dominate globally with:

**A BRIT Award**
**A Grammy nomination**
**7.2 million albums sold**
Major festival appearances including **Download Festival, When We Were Young, Sick New World**, and **NEX FEST**
Collaborations with **Ed Sheeran, Yungblud, Machine Gun Kelly, and Sigrid**

## **Rock for People 2026 — More Heavy Music Than Ever**

## Why Iron Maiden’s Legacy Matters at Rock for People 2026

Placing **Iron Maiden** at the top of Rock for People 2026 does more than celebrate an anniversary — it anchors the entire festival in heavy metal history. Very few bands can justify a standalone festival day nearly 50 years into their career, and even fewer can do it while still selling out arenas and stadiums worldwide.

That staying power is the result of **Iron Maiden’s legacy**: a discography that helped define the sound, scale, and ambition of heavy metal itself. From early NWOBHM classics to global stadium dominance, Maiden’s catalog continues to influence the generations of bands sharing the Rock for People stage in 2026.

For fans looking to understand how Iron Maiden built a career capable of headlining festivals across five decades, our in-depth breakdown of [**Iron Maiden’s discography and legacy**](/iron-maiden-discography-legacy/) explores the albums, eras, and turning points that made moments like this possible.

## **Festival Expansion, Ticket Details, and Extra-Day Options**

After a record-setting 30th anniversary edition in 2025—featuring **Linkin Park, Slipknot, Guns N’ Roses, Sex Pistols, and Avenged Sevenfold**—Rock for People is once again pushing boundaries by extending to **five days**.

Key ticket info includes:
