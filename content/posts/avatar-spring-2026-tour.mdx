[Avatar](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/avatar/) don’t rest. They don’t reset. They don’t politely disappear between album cycles. They march forward, eyes wide open, dragging their twisted carnival straight through the woods — and now they’re bringing it back to North America. Tickets and tour roundups live on our [Tours & Tickets hub](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/).

The Swedish metal lifers have officially announced a Spring 2026 U.S. headline tour in support of *Don’t Go In The Forest*, their latest full-length, which dropped fittingly on Halloween. If you’ve been paying attention, you already know this record didn’t come quietly. It crept in. Then it grabbed you by the throat.

The band — Johannes Eckerström, Jonas Jarlsby, Tim Öhrström, Henrik Sandelin, and John Alfredsson — already tore through North America once, then immediately doubled down with relentless international dates. This next run isn’t a victory lap. It’s another descent.

The Spring 2026 tour kicks off April 16 in Sacramento and runs through May 20 in Hampton Beach, New Hampshire, with appearances at festivals [Welcome to Rockville 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/welcome-to-rockville-2026/) and [Sonic Temple 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/sonic-temple-2026/). Fleshgod Apocalypse and Frozen Soul are on support, which means this bill leans heavy, punishing, and unapologetically metal. No filler. No mercy.

Eckerström, never one to deliver a normal quote, summed up the band’s return to the States in true Avatar fashion:

“USA. It started off innocently enough. Hiking along on a trail. Sunny. Pleasant. Safe. Then night came, and the trail slowly faded. You can&#8217;t go back, as you don&#8217;t know where you came from. You don&#8217;t even dare to turn around, as you can feel someone, or something, watching… Here. It’s just you and the trees.”

Then he adds, calmly and ominously: “We will be seeing you.”

Avatar aren’t pretending anymore. They know exactly what they are — a fully realized metal institution built on theatrics, riffs, and controlled madness. And live? They’re still one of the most dangerous bands you can see on a stage right now. If you’ve somehow missed them, that’s on you. Fix it.

Tickets go on sale Friday, January 16 at 10am local time. [Get tickets here](https://avatarmetal.com).
