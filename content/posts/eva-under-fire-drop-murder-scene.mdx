Eva Under Fire aren’t interested in dressing things up for radio this time. The Detroit hard rock crew just unleashed a new single, “Murder Scene,” and it hits like a late-night spiral you can actually scream along to — big hooks, tightened riffs, and lyrics that stare straight into the mess most people try to hide. The track is out now via Better Noise Music, and if you want the full impact right away, the lyric video is here:

If the title hits close to home, you’re not alone — and that’s the point. “Murder Scene” isn’t trying to be inspirational wallpaper; it’s the sound of somebody dragging a real fight into the light and daring you to sing along anyway.

Over at Metal Mantra, we love when a band swings for something that actually *means* something — and this one’s got teeth.

What makes “Murder Scene” land isn’t that it’s “heavy” in the press-release sense — it’s heavy in the lived-in sense. Vocalist Amanda Lyberg frames it as a fight with eating disorders, body dysmorphia, anxiety, and the kind of self-doubt that doesn’t get quieter just because you’re chasing a dream. In her words, it’s about “how dreams can become nightmares when the same people who once cheered for you are now criticizing you,” and the song sits right in that uncomfortable space where confidence and collapse trade places hourly.

Lyberg doesn’t play coy about it either: “The dream of being on stage comes with a spotlight on my personal flaws. I’m just a body. To be picked apart and judged and perceived… Anxiety is a liar in my head. It tells me I’m not good enough to be here. So, I fight it.” That’s the spine of “Murder Scene” — not a vague “empowerment” slogan, but the ugly, relentless loop you’re trying to break.

## Where this fits in the Eva Under Fire arc

“Murder Scene” is the follow-up to “Awakening,” the band’s previous single that arrived in October and marked their first new music in a couple years. If “Awakening” was the door cracking open, “Murder Scene” is the band stepping through it with their shoulders squared — more direct, more personal, and more willing to let the cracks show.

One thing that’s easy to miss if you only see Eva Under Fire in headlines is that Lyberg isn’t just writing about trauma — she’s worked with it. She’s a practicing psychotherapist (trauma, grief/loss, addiction recovery), and you can feel that perspective in how these songs avoid the usual rock-script shortcuts. “Murder Scene” doesn’t posture — it documents the fight.

## 2026 Tour Dates

Eva Under Fire are taking “Murder Scene” to the stage immediately, joining Jeris Johnson and Butcher Babies for a U.S. run starting February 8 in Portland. Later this summer, they’re also slated to appear as support (along with Cody Jinks) on select dates of Five Finger Death Punch’s 20th Anniversary World Tour 2026.
