Rock icons **Evanescence** have officially announced a massive **2026 world tour**, marking their most ambitious global run in years. The tour begins with a **full North American leg in June 2026** before expanding into a major UK and European arena campaign in the fall. The run features a rotating support lineup including **Spiritbox**, **Poppy**, **Nova Twins**, and **K.Flay**, making this one of the strongest alternative-heavy packages of the upcoming touring year. Tickets and tour roundups live on our [Tours & Tickets hub](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/).
## North American Leg Begins June 2026

The 2026 world tour launches first in the **United States**, with Evanescence headlining across multiple major markets. While the full routing has not yet been revealed, industry reports confirm that the North American leg begins in **June 2026** and is expected to hit key cities across the U.S. and Canada.

Support for the North American dates is expected to include **Spiritbox** and **Poppy**, building on the groups’ recent collaborative momentum. Evanescence fans in the States will finally see the band return with a large-scale, full-production tour for the first time in years, with more details expected in the coming weeks.
## 2026 UK & European Arena Dates

Following the North American run, Evanescence will head overseas for a **UK and European arena tour** taking place between **September 8 – October 4, 2026**. The band will perform in major arenas across the UK, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal and more.

The European leg features a region-specific support rotation:

**Poppy** – appearing on all UK & European dates
**K.Flay** – supporting the UK shows
**Nova Twins** – supporting the European mainland dates

Early registration interest indicates especially high demand in London, Paris, Berlin, Amsterdam and Madrid.
## Amy Lee on the Tour: Fire, Energy & a New Creative Cycle

**Amy Lee** has described the upcoming world tour as a “reignited era” for Evanescence — one driven by fresh inspiration, creative partnerships and a renewed focus on theatrical live performance. Lee’s recent comments indicate that the band’s 2026 output may tie closely into the tour, hinting at **new music** arriving ahead of or alongside the dates.

The inclusion of Spiritbox, Poppy, Nova Twins and K.Flay reflects Evanescence’s ongoing interest in cross-genre collaboration and modern heavy music. Together, they shape a diverse lineup spanning alt-metal, electronic rock, punk-infused bass music and genre-bending alternative.
## Support Acts: A Multi-Genre Heavy Powerhouse

The 2026 world tour features one of the most eclectic and forward-thinking support bills Evanescence has assembled to date:

**Spiritbox** — a leading force in modern metalcore and progressive heavy music
**Poppy** — bringing industrial-tinged, avant-garde alt-metal energy
**Nova Twins** — delivering a fierce blend of punk, grime and bass-driven rock
**K.Flay** — offering a sharp, emotionally charged alternative rock/hip-hop hybrid

Not every act will appear on every stop, but the overall package positions Evanescence’s 2026 cycle as one of the most musically diverse tours of the year.
## Tickets, Pre-Sales & Registration
