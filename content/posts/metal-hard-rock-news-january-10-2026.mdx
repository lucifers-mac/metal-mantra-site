The metal and hard rock world doesn’t slow down—New tours are locking in, festivals are stacking lineups that demand attention, cruise ships are once again being turned into floating pits, and longtime icons are reminding everyone what survival really looks like. At the same time, the scene is forced to confront uncomfortable truths when headlines turn dark. This is one of those weeks where everything hits at once. Catch more in the [latest Rundown](https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/).

## Bush Announce Spring 2026 U.S. Tour With Mammoth and James And The Cold Gun

Bush are officially back on the road in a big way. The band announced a Spring 2026 U.S. tour kicking off April 7 in Pittsburgh, pairing them with Mammoth—Wolfgang Van Halen’s ever-growing hard rock juggernaut—and rising UK rock outfit James And The Cold Gun. It’s a lineup that bridges eras without feeling forced, and that matters.

This tour feels calculated in the right way. Mammoth bring modern relevance and genuine musicianship, while James And The Cold Gun add a raw, hungry energy that keeps the package from feeling too polished. Bush, meanwhile, remain a reminder that [alternative metal](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/alternative-metal/)’s crossover moment still has teeth when delivered with conviction.

## John Bush Revives Anthrax-Era Material at Milwaukee Metal Festival 2026

John Bush performing [Anthrax](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/anthrax/)-era material live isn’t just a nostalgia grab—it’s a long-overdue acknowledgment of a divisive but important chapter in the band’s history. Bush is set to deliver songs from his tenure with Anthrax at Milwaukee Metal Festival 2026.

The Bush-era albums were heavier, darker, and leaned harder into [thrash metal](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/thrash-metal/) and groove than many fans wanted to admit at the time. Years later, those records hit harder than the arguments ever did.

## Headbangers Boat 2026 Finalizes Lineup for Lamb Of God–Led Voyage

Headbangers Boat has officially locked in its 2026 lineup, led by [Lamb Of God](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/lamb-of-god/) and joined by Death Angel, All Shall Perish, Kylesa, and more. It’s a brutal roster rooted in groove metal and modern extreme sounds.

This isn’t poolside background noise. Headbangers Boat continues to book bands that actually make sense together, turning the cruise into a floating extension of the pit rather than a novelty vacation.

## Former Fire From The Gods Vocalist AJ Channer Arrest Record Comes to Light

Arrest records involving former Fire From The Gods vocalist AJ Channer surfaced this week, detailing charges related to child endangerment. It’s serious, deeply uncomfortable, and not something the scene can shrug off.

When stories like this break, accountability matters more than brand loyalty. The metal world prides itself on honesty—especially when that honesty forces hard conversations.

## Rob Halford Celebrates 40 Years Sober: A Milestone Worth Respect

Rob Halford of [Judas Priest](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/judas-priest/) marked an incredible milestone this week: 40 years sober. In a genre long tied to excess, this achievement stands as a reminder that survival is its own kind of rebellion.

Halford’s longevity in [heavy metal](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/heavy-metal/) isn’t just about iconic vocals or leather-and-studs imagery—it’s about endurance. Four decades sober is monumental, and it deserves respect from every corner of the metal community.
