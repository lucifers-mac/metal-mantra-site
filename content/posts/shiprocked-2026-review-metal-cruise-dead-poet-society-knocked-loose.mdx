I just spent six days on the Carnival Horizon with some of the heaviest bands in modern metal, and I&#8217;m still processing what the hell just happened. We&#8217;ll keep updates rolling in our [ShipRocked coverage](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/shiprocked/).

This was my third [ShipRocked](https://www.shiprocked.com/)—Triple Threat status, for those keeping track—but it was my first time covering it as **Metal Mantra**. The first two times, I was just another metalhead on the ship, soaking it all in. This year? I brought you all with me, and ShipRocked 2026 delivered in ways I wasn&#8217;t expecting.

The lineup was stacked: Knocked Loose, Halestorm, Motionless In White, Wage War, Avatar, and dozens more across six days at sea. But here&#8217;s what no press release will tell you—ShipRocked isn&#8217;t just about the bands. It&#8217;s about being trapped on a floating metal festival with nowhere to escape, where the band you just watched destroys a stage set wanders over to watch the next act right next to you. It&#8217;s chaos, community, and catharsis all at once.

### **The Performances That Mattered**

**[Dead Poet Society](/tag/dead-poet-society/) owned this cruise.** They played two sets—one in the ship&#8217;s theater and one on the Lido Deck—and both were absolutely flawless. Jack Underkofler has the best voice I heard all week, and that&#8217;s saying something when you&#8217;re sharing a boat with some of the biggest names in modern metal. The theater set had that intimate, dialed-in energy where every note hit perfectly. The deck set brought the chaos. Between setlist choices, stage presence, and sound quality, DPS was firing on all cylinders. If you slept on them, you missed out. [Check out their latest album on vinyl](https://amzn.to/4two6Vc).

**[House of Protection](/tag/house-of-protection/) brought pure, unfiltered chaos** to the Lido Deck in the best way possible. Their set was messy, fun, and exactly what an outdoor metal cruise performance should be. No pretense, just raw energy and a crowd that fed off it. These are the kind of sets that make ShipRocked special—bands that understand the assignment and lean into the absurdity of playing heavy music on a cruise ship.

**[Wage War](/tag/wage-war/)&#8216;s opening night set was a cathartic release.** They came out swinging on the first night and reminded everyone why they&#8217;re one of the best live [metalcore](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/metalcore/) acts right now. Tight, heavy, and emotionally charged. The set built the energy that would define the rest of the week, and Wage War delivered exactly what the crowd needed to kick things off right. Catch them on tour—grab tickets here.

**[Knocked Loose](/tag/knocked-loose/) tried to sink the boat.** I&#8217;m not exaggerating. You&#8217;re technically not allowed to mosh or crowd surf on ShipRocked for safety reasons, and that rule lasted approximately five minutes into Knocked Loose&#8217;s first set before the entire front section erupted. I was on the rail for this one, and Shield Security deserves an award for catching surfer after surfer while somehow keeping everyone safe and smiling. The crowd was the most insane I&#8217;ve seen in three years of ShipRocked. Bryan Garris and the crew knew exactly what they were doing, and they did it anyway. Respect.

**[The Funeral Portrait](/tag/the-funeral-portrait/)** might have been my favorite surprise of the cruise. You could tell being on ShipRocked meant everything to them. Lee Jennings was everywhere—taking photos, talking to fans, genuinely having the time of his life—and that energy came through in their performances. When a band is that visibly stoked to be there, the crowd feels it. Their sets were proof that ShipRocked isn&#8217;t just about the biggest names on the lineup; it&#8217;s about bands that understand what this experience means to the metal community.

**[Holy Wars](/tag/holy-wars/) stepped up huge.** I&#8217;d seen them before, so maybe I should have expected it, but they raised their game on this cruise. They were a massive standout, and they spent an absurd amount of time talking to me and my travel partner between sets. Every time I ran into them after that, they&#8217;d stop to say what&#8217;s up or throw a smile. That&#8217;s the ShipRocked difference—the bands are accessible in ways they never are at land festivals.

### **The Moments Between the Chaos**

Karaoke is always a ShipRocked highlight, and this year didn&#8217;t disappoint. Eric Vanlerberghe from I Prevail singing karaoke at 3 in the morning is exactly the kind of moment that only happens on a metal cruise. No stage, no production, just a dude from one of the biggest metalcore bands having fun with the crowd.

Then there was **The Stowaways**—an all-star cover band made up of musicians from other acts on the lineup—who had both their sets scheduled for the Lido Deck. Friday night&#8217;s second performance got cancelled due to a storm rolling in, but the show must go on. The entire crew and tech staff busted their asses to get the Ocean Plaza stage ready in record time, making sure the music didn&#8217;t stop just because Mother Nature had other plans.

**[Jay Howell](https://www.instagram.com/punksgitcut/)** deserves his own paragraph. The animator and character designer behind Nickelodeon&#8217;s *Sanjay and Craig* and Fox&#8217;s *Bob&#8217;s Burgers* was doing free portrait sessions on the ship, and once people realized who he was and what he was doing, the line became insane. He stayed late every single session to make sure as many people as possible got their portraits done. I got mine done in the first session, and he still remembered me from previous festivals when I ran into him later. Super nice, super personable, and a genuine superhero for committing that much time to fans.

AWOLNATION was one of the most talked-about acts on the boat. A lot of people had never heard of them or were surprised to see them on a metal cruise lineup, but they won over the crowd. That&#8217;s the beauty of ShipRocked&#8217;s eclectic lineups—you discover bands you wouldn&#8217;t have given a chance otherwise.

### **The Ship, The Vibe, The Logistics**

This was ShipRocked&#8217;s first time on the [Carnival Horizon](https://www.carnival.com/cruise-ships/carnival-horizon), and there were some growing pains. The layout is different from previous ships, and things felt more spread out. The casino and bar areas—which were the natural congregation points on past cruises—didn&#8217;t have the same centralized energy this year. Instead, people formed smaller groups scattered around the ship. It wasn&#8217;t bad, just different.

For first-timers (or &#8220;Newbs&#8221; as we call them), the vibe was still incredible. There were just fewer spontaneous crowd moments in the common areas compared to previous years. I also noticed fewer visible artist interactions, but I think that&#8217;s more about the ship&#8217;s layout making it harder to stumble into bands rather than the artists being less present. They were definitely around—you just had to know where to look.

Sets started later than I remember from previous years, and there were a few logistical hiccups that felt like new-ship stress. Nothing catastrophic, but noticeable if you&#8217;ve been on ShipRocked before. The Knocked Loose crowd-surfing chaos tested the limits of what the ship could handle, but Shield Security and the crew managed it without incident. Props to them for keeping it safe without killing the energy.

Between sets? Bring on the food and booze. I ate an unreasonable amount of Guy&#8217;s Burgers, drank way too much Zeus Juice and Splash of the Titans, and hit up the steakhouse for an absurdly cheap price compared to what you&#8217;d pay on land. And then there was the 4am pizza—legitimately some of the best slices I&#8217;ve had, not just &#8220;good for cruise ship food&#8221; but actually good pizza. The food on this cruise was legitimately solid, which is not something you always hear about cruise ships.

### **Why ShipRocked Hits Different**

Here&#8217;s what you won&#8217;t get from [festival recaps](https://metal-mantra.com/category/live/festival-reviews/) or press releases: **ShipRocked is a vacation like no other.** If you love heavy music, this is mecca. You&#8217;re not just attending a festival—you&#8217;re living with the bands, the crew, and thousands of other metalheads for six straight days. There&#8217;s no going home at the end of the night. There&#8217;s no missing a set because you had to leave early. You&#8217;re committed, and so is everyone else on that ship.

The community aspect is what makes ShipRocked irreplaceable. We&#8217;re family, not just for a week but for life. I keep in contact with hundreds of ShipRocked friends year-round. We meet up at other shows and festivals. We plan trips together. The bonds you form on that ship are real because you&#8217;re all living the same experience together—no outside distractions, no escape routes, just six days of heavy music and shared chaos.

And here&#8217;s the thing that separates ShipRocked from every other [festival](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/festivals/): **when the &#8220;rockstar&#8221; finishes their set, they wander over to watch the next band right next to you.** Nowhere else does that happen. At land festivals, the bands are in VIP areas or tour buses or already on the road to the next city. On ShipRocked, they&#8217;re stuck on the boat with you. They&#8217;re at the bars, the pool deck, the karaoke sessions. They&#8217;re fans of the other bands too, and they&#8217;re living the same experience you are.

If there were disappointments, they were personal and not lineup-specific. Some people wanted heavier bands, some wanted more variety. That&#8217;s always going to happen with any festival. But the lineup delivered on what ShipRocked promises: an eclectic mix of modern metal, metalcore, deathcore, and hard rock with enough variety to keep six days interesting.

### **Final Thoughts**

ShipRocked isn&#8217;t cheap, and it&#8217;s not convenient. You&#8217;re committing to six days with no escape route, no early exits, and no plan B if the lineup doesn&#8217;t hit the way you hoped. But here&#8217;s the thing: that all-in commitment is exactly why it works.

Every land festival I&#8217;ve been to ends the same way—everyone scatters at the end of the weekend, you drive home exhausted, and by Monday it feels like it never happened. ShipRocked doesn&#8217;t let you off that easy. You&#8217;re locked in, and so is everyone else. The bands can&#8217;t leave. The crowd can&#8217;t thin out. You&#8217;re all stuck together, and that forced proximity creates something you can&#8217;t replicate anywhere else.

This was my first time covering ShipRocked as [Metal Mantra](https://metal-mantra.com/), and it gave me a completely different lens on the experience. Watching Dead Poet Society nail two flawless sets, seeing Knocked Loose turn the Lido Deck into a mosh pit that shouldn&#8217;t have been physically possible, catching The Funeral Portrait at their most genuine—these aren&#8217;t just performances. They&#8217;re proof that when you remove the escape routes and force everyone to be present, the music hits harder.

If you&#8217;ve been on the fence about booking ShipRocked, here&#8217;s what you need to understand: this isn&#8217;t a festival you can half-ass. You can&#8217;t show up for a day, catch your favorite band, and leave. You&#8217;re either all in or you&#8217;re not there at all. And if you&#8217;re all in? You&#8217;ll understand why people keep coming back year after year.

One more thing: **don&#8217;t wait.** ShipRocked sells out every single year. The waitlist gets long, and watching cabin availability disappear while you&#8217;re still deciding is brutal. If you know you want to go, book the second cabins drop. Hesitation costs you a spot on the boat.

ShipRocked 2027 is already locked in: January 24-30, departing from Miami and hitting Mahogany Bay in Roatan, Honduras, and Cozumel, Mexico. I&#8217;ll be booking the second tickets go live. 

See you on the boat in 2027. 🤘
