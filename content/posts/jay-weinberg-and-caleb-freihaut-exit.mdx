In the last couple of days the heavy music world has been hit with not one but two lineup departures that carry real emotional weight — not the usual behind-the-scenes reshuffling, but musicians leaving bands where their presence mattered. Jay Weinberg has announced he’s stepping away from **[Suicidal Tendencies](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/suicidal-tendencies/)**, and Caleb Freihaut is out of **The Funeral Portrait**. These aren’t dry press releases — they feel like tectonic shifts in their respective corners of the scene. *More on Metal Mantra:* [News](https://metal-mantra.com/news/)

Let’s be blunt: losing a member isn’t inherently news unless that member was a defining part of what made a band tick. In Weinberg’s case, he’s been a high-visibility drummer for years across multiple projects. After joining Suicidal Tendencies in 2024 following his decade-plus tenure behind the kit for Slipknot, Jay posted a heartfelt message explaining that the next chapter of his life — including becoming a father and chasing passion projects — means he’s leaving the Cyco legacy behind after nearly two years and countless miles in the van. The split sounds genuinely amicable, but that doesn’t stop it from hitting like a gut-punch for a lot of fans who came to associate him with ST’s touring and recent material.

Meanwhile Calvin “Caleb” Freihaut’s departure from **[The Funeral Portrait](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/the-funeral-portrait/)** carries a very different kind of weight — because this is a band very much on the ascent. TFP have quietly positioned themselves as one of the most talked-about up-and-coming acts heading into 2026, blending theatrical rock, post-hardcore bite, and metal-adjacent intensity in a way that’s been connecting with a rapidly growing audience. Caleb wasn’t just a background contributor; he was part of the chemistry that helped push the band from cult favorite territory into legitimate breakout conversation. When someone exits a band right as momentum is accelerating, it naturally raises eyebrows — not because of drama, but because timing matters.

What makes the situation even more surreal is the overlap. Both **The Funeral Portrait** and **Suicidal Tendencies** are slated to appear on [Shiprocked](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/shiprocked/) in just a couple of weeks — a floating festival that thrives on fan access, shared stages, and scene crossover. On paper, that lineup now feels almost ironic. Two bands from wildly different eras, both dealing with key departures right before stepping onto one of the most visible rock-centric platforms of the year. That kind of coincidence doesn’t happen often, and it’s not lost on fans paying attention.

It’s not just these two. Heavy music has been in something of a lineup shuffle — not mass defections, but meaningful exits. Early last year, Exodus saw longtime frontman Steve “Zetro” Souza part ways with the band, bringing back Rob Dukes in his stead; it wasn’t acrimony on tour, but a classic “marriage over” exit that still had claws in fan discussions.

And while it was announced before that Brandon Ellis had left **The Black Dahlia Murder** in early 2025, that shakeup still lingers in the scene’s memory because of how integral he was to that band’s sound for years. Some exits fade fast. Others hang in the air long after the announcement post disappears down the timeline.

Departure news isn’t always bad news — bands evolve, people grow, priorities shift — but when someone like Weinberg exits a high-profile outfit, or when a key player leaves rising bands like The Funeral Portrait or Dayseeker, it feels like a snapshot of how even the most dedicated musicians wrestle with the tension between touring life, family, side projects, and long-term creative goals.

Weinberg made a point of thanking Suicidal Tendencies and the extended “ST Army” in his farewell, framing this as a step toward becoming a first-time father and pushing his own artistic endeavors. That’s not vague PR speak — it’s a drummer who’s playing the long game and admitting he’s exhausted the well of what he wanted out of that chapter.

Caleb’s departure from The Funeral Portrait doesn’t come wrapped in mystery or coded language — and that honesty matters. In his own words, Caleb explained that “after many years of heavy touring, which have resulted in intense burnout,” he made the decision to step away in order to prioritize his mental health and invest in other parts of his life. That kind of clarity cuts through the usual speculation fast. Still, in a scene that runs on momentum, timing always invites conversation. When members leave just ahead of major tours or release cycles, it naturally feeds into questions about direction, chemistry, and the toll relentless grind culture takes on musicians — even the ones who look like they’re winning from the outside.

The broader picture? Band member exits are happening, but not in a way that suggests wholesale collapse. This feels like individual stories about people making personal choices — whether it’s reclaiming life outside of punishing tour schedules or stepping away from a project that’s outgrown its earlier mission. For heavy fans, it’s a reminder that the metal and hardcore landscapes are living, breathing things where the only constant is flux.

We’ll be tracking these stories as they develop — new replacements, side projects, and the ripple effects that come with lineup changes will all shape the heavy music narrative in the months ahead.
