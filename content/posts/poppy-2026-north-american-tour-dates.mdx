Poppy is taking *Empty Hands* on the road this summer with a full North American run, and the routing is officially locked. The **“Constantly Nowhere”** tour begins **July 7 in Washington, D.C.** and wraps **August 19 in Nashville**, covering 29 dates across the U.S. and Canada.

**Landmvrks** and **Thousand Below** are confirmed as support across the run. This package gives the tour real weight for fans who want modern heavy music that can hit both emotionally and physically in the same set.

For Poppy, this leg is a direct live extension of *Empty Hands* — bigger rooms, stronger routing, and a bill that makes sense top to bottom. The run moves through key East Coast markets early, into Canada, then through the Midwest, West Coast, Southwest, and the South before closing in Tennessee.

## Ticket On-Sale Details

Artist and Citi presales begin **Wednesday, February 18 at 12:00 p.m. local time** and end **Thursday, February 19 at 11:59 p.m. local time**. General on-sale starts **Friday, February 20 at 10:00 a.m. local time**.

## Why This Run Matters

Poppy’s catalog has never stayed in one lane for long, and this tour reflects that same evolution in real time. The lineup pairing with Landmvrks and Thousand Below strengthens the full-show experience rather than treating support as an afterthought. You get a complete night that tracks with where heavy and alternative music are colliding in 2026.

The routing itself is efficient and built for momentum. There are no long dead zones, no obvious soft section in the middle, and no sign this is being treated like a casual run. For fans, that usually means one thing: if your market is on this list, lock your ticket early and don’t wait for resale regret.
