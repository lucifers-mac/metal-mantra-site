**Indian folk metal trailblazers Bloodywood have announced their 2026 North American headline run, the “System of a Brown Tour,” marking a major milestone in the band’s global ascent and their first full-length U.S. headline tour to date.** The announcement follows a breakout year that saw the New Delhi-based group move from viral success to sold-out venues, major festival stages, and high-profile support slots alongside some of modern metal’s most visible acts. Tickets and tour roundups live on our [Tours & Tickets hub](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/).

Produced by Live Nation, the 25-city tour launches April 10, 2026 in Des Moines, Iowa and runs through mid-May, wrapping in Columbus, Ohio. Bloodywood will be joined by an intentionally diverse support lineup featuring U.S. metalcore act **The Pretty Wild**, Mexican “Flow Pesado” rock collective **Ladrones**, and Catalonian melodic metal band **Ankor**, reinforcing the tour’s global scope and cross-genre appeal. Tickets and VIP packages will be available via [LiveNation.com](https://www.livenation.com/artist/K8vZ917_RDV/bloodywood-events) and [Bloodywood.net](https://www.bloodywood.net/tour), with artist presales beginning Tuesday, December 9 and general onsale opening Friday, December 12 at 10am local time.

The “System of a Brown Tour” represents a full-circle moment for Bloodywood’s relationship with North American audiences. In Summer 2025, the band completed a sold-out U.S. run supporting BABYMETAL, introducing their culturally fused sound to thousands of new fans night after night. That momentum carried into Europe, where Bloodywood served as direct support for Halestorm, further proving their ability to hold their own on large stages across continents. This headline tour is the culmination of that steady rise, bringing Bloodywood’s complete live vision to U.S. venues for the first time and expanding their footprint within the broader [metal tours coverage](/news/metal-tours/) landscape.

“Our spring headline run of the U.S. will be an epic full circle moment,” says rapper and vocalist Raoul Kerr. “It started this summer supporting BABYMETAL, and now it culminates in a run where we bring our full-length set to the U.S. for the first time. It’s the best songs from our new album and the best of our first album — it’s the kind of set that pushes the limit of any venue to the max.” For longtime followers of the band, the tour promises a definitive live statement rather than a scaled-down support performance.

Festival appearances play a key role in anchoring the tour’s visibility, with Bloodywood set to appear at [Sick New World](https://metal-mantra.com/sick-new-world/) in Las Vegas, [Welcome to Rockville](https://metal-mantra.com/welcome-to-rockville-returns-in-2026/) in Daytona Beach, and [Sonic Temple](https://metal-mantra.com/sonic-temple-2026-festival-coverage/) in Columbus. These bookings place the band alongside the biggest names in contemporary heavy music while exposing them to massive crossover audiences, further accelerating their momentum in the U.S. market.

The support lineup reinforces Bloodywood’s identity-driven approach to heavy music. Rather than stacking stylistically similar acts, the tour brings together artists representing different regions and perspectives within the modern metal landscape. The Pretty Wild deliver a modern U.S. metalcore sound built for high-energy club rooms, Ladrones blend hip-hop cadence with heavy rock under their self-described “Flow Pesado” banner, and Ankor contribute a polished melodic metal edge rooted in the European scene. The result is a contrast-driven bill that mirrors the evolving global nature of heavy music.

Bloodywood’s reputation as a must-see live act has been solidified by both fan response and critical recognition. Outlets including Revolver, Metal Injection, Consequence, Guitar World, and PASTE have highlighted the band’s ability to translate cultural fusion into an explosive and cohesive live experience. Recent sold-out performances in London underscored that reputation, with crowd reactions demonstrating the universal resonance of Bloodywood’s sound regardless of geography.

The tour also continues to support the band’s latest album, *NU DELHI*, released in 2025 via Fearless Records. The album functions as both a love letter to the band’s home region and a broader statement on the future of global metal, blending nu metal, modern metalcore, melodic hard rock, and Indian folk elements into a fingerprint-distinct sound. Fans can stream the album via [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4jpCwzG4RZxPp9YbODzFqG) and explore the band’s catalog across major digital platforms.
