Monday is the cleanup day. The weekend doesn’t always deliver one giant headline — it delivers a pile of smaller ones that add up to the same thing: the machine keeps moving. Here’s what mattered, and what you can actually act on.

## Nevermore Confirm 2026 Reunion Lineup, Sign With Reigning Phoenix Music, and Tease a New Album

Nevermore are officially back in motion with a full lineup announcement and a label signing — which is a lot more meaningful than the usual “new chapter” breadcrumb trail. Jeff Loomis and Van Williams are steering the reboot and they’ve brought in vocalist Berzan Onen, guitarist Jack Cattoi, bassist Semir Ozerkan, plus a new album in the works. That last part is the real tell: this isn’t just a nostalgia victory lap.

## LOUDNESS Announce 45th‑Anniversary Dates (U.S., Japan, and Europe)

LOUDNESS are celebrating 45 years with a run that hits the U.S. first (including a stop at Hell’s Heroes in Houston and a Whisky A Go Go date) before shifting into Japan and European festival appearances. If you’ve somehow never seen them, this is one of those “stop debating it” tours — you don’t get infinite chances with bands that helped build the lane in the first place.

## W.A.S.P. Announce “1984 To Headless” 2026 North American Tour With KK’s Priest

W.A.S.P. are packaging this run around their first four albums — the era that made them infamous and untouchable in the theatrical hard rock world. The “1984 To Headless” tour runs September 10 through October 31, with KK’s Priest as direct support. If you’re going, don’t overthink it. These kinds of nostalgia‑with‑teeth tours are exactly the ones people decide on late and then complain they missed.

## Avatar Cut Their London Show Short After Crew Members Were Shocked On an Electrified Stage

Avatar pulled the plug early on their Valentine’s Day London stop at Exhibition White City after an electrical issue turned the stage into a hazard. Johannes Eckerström said the stage became electrified, damaged gear, and severely shocked two crew members — and the band deemed the venue unsafe to continue. That’s the correct call. You don’t gamble with people’s safety so you can finish a setlist.

## Castle Rat Add Two Headlining Shows Around the Amon Amarth + Dethklok Run

Castle Rat are already on the big Amon Amarth + Dethklok tour, but they also added two standalone headliners: Grand Rapids (with Sacred Leather) and Anaheim (with Death Chant). The arena package is the spectacle. The headliners are where you catch a band while the room size is still human.

## The HU + Apocalyptica Announce Spring 2026 U.S. Tour With The Rasmus

This is a clean “different flavors, same punch” bill: The HU’s Hunnu rock energy, Apocalyptica’s symphonic heaviness, and The Rasmus across the run. Dates start May 12 and wrap June 7 in Anaheim. If your city doesn’t get weird pairings often, this is one of the better ones 2026 is offering.

## Warped Tour 2026 Keeps Stacking Names

Warped’s rollout is doing what Warped always did: throw a ridiculous range of bands at the wall and let the crowd sort it out. Whether you love the genre whiplash or hate it, the lineup is big enough that most people will find something worth showing up for.
