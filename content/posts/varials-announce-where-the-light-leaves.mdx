**New album lands Feb 27 via Fearless Records — watch the “Where the Light Leaves” video now.** More metal news: [News hub](https://metal-mantra.com/news/).

Philadelphia-based metalcore outfit **Varials** — Skyler Conder (vocals), Shane Lyons (guitar), Mike Foley (bass), and Sean Rauchut (drums) — are back and heavier than ever. After re-introducing themselves earlier this fall with the crushing single “I’ll Find the Dark,” their first track since 2022’s output, the band has now officially announced their long-awaited new album ***Where the Light Leaves***. The record drops on **February 27, 2026** via Fearless Records. [Pre-order here.](https://varialspa.net/)

To mark the announcement, Varials have shared the official video for the title track — “Where the Light Leaves” — a brutal and atmospheric dose of metalcore fury. Watch it now.

## A Dark Vision Realized — What Skyler Conder Says

Vocalist Skyler Conder explains that “**Where the Light Leaves** is the key introduction to the overall idea of the album itself.” He adds that through a period of inner turmoil and feeling trapped “within my mind, in a sense of purgatory,” the track and its visuals serve as a raw depiction of mental anguish — eventually leading to acceptance and survival. The song and video aim to capture that journey.

## Why *Where the Light Leaves* Matters

Since forming in 2013 in Philadelphia, Varials have built a reputation for brutal breakdowns, heavy-hitting riffs, and raw emotional honesty. Their earlier albums — from 2017’s *Pain Again* and 2019’s *In Darkness* to 2022’s *Scars for You to Remember* — showed their continual evolution.

With *Where the Light Leaves*, the band digs deeper. Produced by longtime collaborator Josh Schroeder, the album channels ferocity, atmosphere, and emotional weight. Fans can expect destructive hardcore energy, nu-metal-tinged grooves, and haunting lyrics — a record that reflects both pain and catharsis.

Varials have already proven themselves on tours with some of the scene’s hardest-hitting acts — and this album promises to bring that live intensity to recorded form again. Keep an eye out for more news, tour announcements, and first listens.
