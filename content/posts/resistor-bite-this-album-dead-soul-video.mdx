Long Island’s Resistor just announced their new album *BITE THIS!*, dropping March 27, and they’re introducing it with the new single “Dead Soul.” If you like your modern hardcore laced with OG nu-metal swagger (and actual turntables), this one’s built to leave a mark.

**Drops March 27 — pre-orders live now.**

Billed as “knuckle dragging wika wika core,” the five-piece (vocals Anthony Grambo, guitar Anthony Conti, bass Ian Schneider, turntables Anthony Arce, drums Peter Smith) lean into grooves that hit like a wrecking ball — but with enough hooks and bounce to keep the pit moving. Schneider calls “Dead Soul” the perfect opening statement for the record, adding that Resistor’s themes have always boiled down to a very direct message, and this track is no exception.

The album was put together with producer Randy LeBoeuf (Kublai Khan TX, The Acacia Strain, Gideon), and the band will be on the road with Yosemite In Black ahead of release day.
