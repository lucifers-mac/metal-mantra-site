If you spend any time in a car, at the gym, or on a plane, you already know that Audible is the move. What you might not know is how deep the metal catalog goes. Band biographies, oral histories, frontman memoirs — there is a legitimate library of heavy music storytelling sitting in there, and most of it is narrated by the people who lived it. Here are the ones worth your time.

New to Audible? Every title on this list is available on a free 30-day trial. [Start your free trial here](https://www.audible.com/search?keywords=metal+biography&tag=metalmantra08-20) and you can grab one of these for nothing.

### Mustaine: A Heavy Metal Memoir — Dave Mustaine

The definitive metal autobiography. Dave Mustaine covers everything — the Metallica years, the humiliating ouster, the descent into addiction, the Megadeth era, and the faith that pulled him back. It’s 11 hours and 38 minutes of the kind of honesty that most people in his position would never put on record. Narrated by Tom Wayland with over 1,100 ratings. This is the one you start with.

### Confess: The Autobiography — Rob Halford

Rob Halford narrates his own story, which already makes it required listening. The Metal God walks through five decades of Judas Priest, his 1998 public coming out, his battles with addiction, and what it means to have lived a life at the center of heavy metal culture. 13 hours, 1,458 ratings, narrated by the man himself. There is no better way to hear this story than in his voice. [Listen on Audible](https://www.audible.com/search?keywords=Confess+Rob+Halford+autobiography&tag=metalmantra08-20)

### Down with the System — Serj Tankian

System of a Down’s frontman delivers something you would not expect from a metal memoir — a deeply political, philosophical, and genuinely moving account of growing up Armenian-American, building one of the most distinct bands in modern heavy music, and carrying the weight of genocide recognition as a public mission. Narrated by Tankian himself, almost 10 hours. One of the more surprising listens on this list.

### The First 21 — Nikki Sixx

Nikki Sixx already told the Mötley Crüe story in *The Dirt*. This one goes further back — the first 21 years of his life before any of that happened. The abuse, the abandonment, the desperation that drove him toward music in the first place. Narrated by Sixx himself, 5 hours 29 minutes. If you’ve read *The Dirt* and want to understand where he actually came from, this is the companion piece.

### Biblical: Rob Halford’s Heavy Metal Scriptures — Rob Halford

Less memoir, more manifesto. Halford wrote this as a love letter to heavy metal — the culture, the fans, the history, and what it all means to the people who never grew out of it. 12 hours and 38 minutes, narrated by Halford himself again. If *Confess* is his life story, *Biblical* is his philosophy. Read them back to back.

### I Am Ozzy — Ozzy Osbourne

Ozzy narrates his own insanity across 12 hours — Black Sabbath, the bat, the dove, the Sharon years, the reality TV era, and the solo career that turned him into a solo legend in his own right. It is, predictably, hilarious and terrifying in equal measure. Required reading (or listening) for anyone who wants to understand how heavy metal became a cultural institution.
