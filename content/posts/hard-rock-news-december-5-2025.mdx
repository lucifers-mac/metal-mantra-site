Today’s heavy-music news cycle is packed: surprise singles from hard-rock icons, cinematic farewell events, candid interviews from scene legends, touring plans, and cultural honors. Here’s your Metal Mantra daily rundown of what’s happening across **metal, hard rock and metalcore** right now. Catch more in the [latest Rundown](https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/).
## Guns N’ Roses Drop Two New Singles

**Guns N’ Roses** have released two new songs, “Nothin’” and “Atlas,” marking their first new material since 2023. “Atlas” roars with classic GN’R swagger while “Nothin’” offers a more introspective piano-driven approach. Both tracks are available digitally now and will see physical releases on vinyl, cassette and Japan-exclusive SHM-CD. Guitarist Slash hinted that a full-length album is in the works, though he noted it will happen organically.
## Megadeth Announce Global Cinematic Event Ahead of Final Album

Thrash veterans **Megadeth** have teamed with Trafalgar Releasing for *Megadeth: Behind the Mask*, a one-night cinematic experience premiering January 22, 2026. The film will debut in over 1,000 theaters worldwide and includes a full listen to the band’s self-titled final studio album, out January 23. Tickets go on sale December 11, marking the start of Megadeth’s farewell campaign.
## Nergal Questions Modern Arena Metal

In a new interview, **Behemoth** frontman Nergal admitted he doesn’t connect with contemporary arena-metal acts like Parkway Drive, Avenged Sevenfold and Sleep Token, calling their music “not my DNA.” He encouraged fans to catch legacy acts such as Metallica, Iron Maiden and Guns N’ Roses while they still tour, warning that the era of major hard-rock icons is coming to an end.
## Iron Maiden’s Steve Harris Not Ready to Retire

**Iron Maiden** bassist Steve Harris, who turns 70 in March, says retirement isn’t on his mind. In a conversation with Kerrang!, Harris explained he stays fit by playing football and tennis and still relishes performing. He acknowledged that the band will eventually have to consider stepping down but insisted that moment has not yet arrived.
## Phil Campbell & The Bastard Sons Seek Permanent Singer

Former Motörhead guitarist **Phil Campbell** revealed that his band, Phil Campbell and the Bastard Sons, are still searching for a permanent vocalist following the departure of Joel Peters. With eight to ten song ideas demoed and plans to record in early 2026, the group has enlisted Fury’s Julian Jenkins as a temporary vocalist for their current European tour.
## Opeth Drummer Shares Audition Video

**Opeth** drummer Waltteri Väyrynen posted the 2022 audition video that earned him his place in the band, performing “The Devil’s Orchard.” He admitted the take isn’t perfect but said revisiting it highlights how his playing has evolved since joining the Swedish progressive-metal outfit.
## Anthrax Finish Long-Awaited Album

**Anthrax** drummer Charlie Benante confirmed that the band’s first album since 2016 is complete and expected early next year. Only one song remains to be mixed. Benante said the band pushed their sound further than ever before and promised a new single will drop before year’s end.
## Slipknot’s Clown Pushes Album to 2026

Slipknot percussionist Shawn “Clown” Crahan updated fans on the long-delayed Look Outside Your Window project—originally speculated for 2025, the experimental record is now expected in 2026, with Crahan describing it as having a Radiohead-like vibe and noting that the album has been handed over to management.
## Mötley Crüe Outline 2026 Tour Plans

**Mötley Crüe** bassist Nikki Sixx discussed the band’s upcoming 2026 “Return of Carnival of Sins” tour, noting the schedule is deliberately spaced out to reduce fatigue. The 33-date trek will feature two-week runs separated by two-week breaks. Sixx emphasized the importance of health and family time and teased new stage production alongside support acts Extreme and Tesla.
## Birmingham Airport Rejects Ozzy Osbourne Renaming Petition

The CEO of Birmingham Airport dismissed a petition with nearly 77,000 signatures to rename the airport after **Ozzy Osbourne**. Nick Barton stated that while the airport will honor Osbourne with a mural, changing the name is not an option because it could hinder future development plans.
