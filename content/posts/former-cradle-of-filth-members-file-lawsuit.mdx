After months of public tension, a group of former **Cradle of Filth** members have filed a formal **lawsuit against Dani Filth**, the band’s associated companies and their management. The **Cradle of Filth lawsuit**, lodged in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, alleges unpaid royalties, misappropriation of likeness, copyright infringement and more tied to years of touring, merch and recording activity.

## Who Is Suing Cradle of Filth and Dani Filth?

According to court filings, **six former Cradle of Filth members** are listed as plaintiffs: keyboardist **Zoë Marie Federoff**, guitarist **Marek “Ashok” Šmerda**, long-time guitarist **Paul Allender**, guitarist **Richard Shaw**, former keyboardist/vocalist **Lindsay Matheson** (aka Lindsay Schoolcraft) and model **Sasha Baxter** (aka Sasha Massacre), who appeared in the band’s music videos.

The defendants named in the lawsuit include frontman **Dani Filth** (Daniel Lloyd Davey), **Cradle of Filth LLP**, **Cradle of Filth Touring Limited** and **The Oracle Management**, the company involved with the band’s business affairs.
## Key Allegations in the Cradle of Filth Lawsuit

The lawsuit paints a picture of long-running disputes over money, contracts and control of creative work. Among the major claims, the plaintiffs allege:

**Unauthorized use of likeness:** The band and its business entities allegedly continued to use former members’ images on merchandise, vinyl, posters, online listings and paid meet-and-greet packages after they left the group, without proper permission or compensation.
**Unpaid royalties:** Several plaintiffs claim they are owed royalties for live performances, sound recordings and video appearances tied to their time in Cradle of Filth.
**Copyright infringement:** The complaint accuses the defendants of using copyrighted works, sigils and other designs created by former keyboardist/vocalist Lindsay Matheson without approval.
**Defamation and “toxic” work environment:** Federoff and Šmerda allege that statements made about them after they left the band were defamatory and contributed to reputational damage, while also pointing to years of alleged low pay, high stress and unprofessional behaviour from those “above” them.
**Unjust enrichment and failure to account:** The plaintiffs say they were denied transparent accounting for merch sales, meet-and-greet income and other revenue streams while the band continued to profit from their work and likenesses.

In addition to financial damages, the lawsuit seeks to halt any further commercial use of the plaintiffs’ names, images and performances on Cradle of Filth merchandise or promotional materials.
## Background: Departures, Contracts and Growing Tensions

The legal action follows a turbulent period for Cradle of Filth. In mid-2025, Zoë Federoff and Marek “Ashok” Šmerda exited the band mid-tour, publicly criticising what they described as low pay, high stress and “toxic” internal dynamics. Their social posts and statements included screenshots of contracts they claimed were heavily one-sided and described by their lawyer as among the harshest session agreements they had seen.

Shortly after their departure, Dani Filth responded with his own statement, disputing their characterisations and defending the band’s business practices. That back-and-forth set the stage for a deeper conflict that has now moved from social media into the courtroom.
## What Dani Filth and the Band Have Said So Far

At the time of writing, official responses from Dani Filth and the defendants have been limited to prior statements addressing the broader dispute. In those comments, Filth has rejected allegations of exploitation and suggested that contracts and internal agreements have been misunderstood or misrepresented.

The lawsuit, however, escalates the conflict into a high-stakes legal battle, with the former members seeking not only monetary damages but also court orders restricting how Cradle of Filth can use historic imagery, recordings and designs connected to their time in the band.

## Why This Lawsuit Matters for Metal and Music Business

The **Cradle of Filth lawsuit** taps into larger conversations about how metal and rock bands handle contracts, likeness rights and royalty splits—especially for touring and session players who may not hold equity in the core brand. For many fans, it raises hard questions about how legacy heavy bands operate behind the scenes, and whether long-term contributors are properly compensated when merch and catalog sales continue long after they leave.

If the plaintiffs prevail, the case could set a notable example around **musician likeness rights**, how older catalog imagery is used on new merch runs, and what obligations established bands have to former members when it comes to royalty accounting and intellectual property.
## What Happens Next?

The lawsuit against Dani Filth and Cradle of Filth’s business entities is still in its early stages. The court will next work through responses from the defendants, potential motions to dismiss or narrow the claims, and any early settlement talks. Until then, all of the allegations remain just that—**allegations**—and no court has ruled on the merits of the case.

Metal Mantra will continue to track filings and statements from both sides as the **Cradle of Filth lawsuit** develops.
