##  Megadeth Unleash “Puppet Parade” Ahead of Self-Titled Farewell Album

Dave Mustaine and the boys aren’t going quietly into that good night. [Megadeth](https://www.megadeth.com) have dropped their fourth and likely final single, “Puppet Parade,” from their upcoming self-titled album landing this Friday, January 23rd. This is it, folks—the final studio album from one of thrash metal’s most iconic outfits, closing out a 40-year legacy that helped define the genre. The track carries that signature Megadeth ferocity with a moody, menacing edge that proves Mustaine still has venom in his veins. Released via Mustaine’s Tradecraft imprint on Frontiers Label Group’s BLKIIBLK label, *Megadeth* features 10 tracks including a reimagined version of “Ride the Lightning”—a full-circle moment as Mustaine pays respect to his early days co-writing with Metallica. The city of La Vergne, Tennessee even proclaimed January 17th as “Megadeth Day” to honor the band’s monumental contributions to heavy music. With a farewell tour projected to span three to five years, this is your chance to witness thrash royalty one last time.
