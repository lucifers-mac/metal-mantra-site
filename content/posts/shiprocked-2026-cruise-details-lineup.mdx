Get ready to set sail into rock-and-roll legend: Shiprocked 2026 — the 16th annual edition of the rock-festival-at-sea — is locked and loaded for **January 25–31, 2026** aboard the **Carnival Horizon**, departing from Miami. What makes this sailing stand out: a Greek-mythology-themed adventure, over two dozen killer bands, tropical Bahamian ports, and the kind of nonstop music + vacation energy that only Shiprocked delivers.

##  Route, Theme & Experience

Shiprocked 2026 will cruise from Miami to three stunning Bahamian destinations — the private-island paradise of Half Moon Cay, the soon-to-open Carnival private port Celebration Key, plus the city-port of Nassau, Bahamas — before returning.

This year’s theme leans heavily into ancient Greek mythology: attendees are encouraged to channel their inner rock gods and goddesses, diving into “god-tier” shows, epic theme nights, and a sea-faring odyssey of music, myth, and madness.

But beyond the concerts, Shiprocked doubles as a rock-and-roll summer camp at sea. Guests can expect artist-hosted activities, live band karaoke, dodgeball tournaments, blackjack, trivia contests, morning yoga, mixers, theme parties, and countless opportunities to connect with fellow “Shiprockers.” It’s part vacation, part festival, part floating community.

##  Lineup Highlights: Titans of Rock & Metal

The 2026 lineup is nothing short of monstrous. Headliners include **Halestorm**, **Motionless In White**, and **Knocked Loose** — each ready to bring their heavy-hitting energy and loyal fanbases aboard for a week like no other.

Also gracing the waves: **Wage War**, **AWOLNATION**, **Suicidal Tendencies**, **Avatar**, **Starset**, **From Ashes To New**, and **Kittie** — plus a wide array of rising and underground acts spanning metalcore, alt-rock, hardcore, and more. Bands like ’68, Archetypes Collide, aurorawave, The Barbarians of California, Dead Poet Society, DeathByRomy, Dinosaur Pile-Up, The Funeral Portrait, Holy Wars, House of Protection, Lowlives, Not Enough Space, Shepherd’s Reign, UnityTX, Zero 9:36 — and the beloved all-star band **The Stowaways** — round out the massive lineup.
