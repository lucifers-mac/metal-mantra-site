## Vicious Rumors Announce Massive 2026 U.S. Tour, Drop New “Abusement Park” Video

Vicious Rumors aren’t here to play nostalgia bingo. They’re here to remind everyone—loudly—that U.S. power metal still has teeth. The band just unleashed a new video for **“Abusement Park”** and paired it with a sprawling 2026 U.S. tour that reads like a no-frills, bar-to-the-back-wall metal assault. Tickets and tour roundups live on our [Tours & Tickets hub](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/).

“Abusement Park” comes off *[The Devil’s Asylum](/the-devils-asylum-vicious-rumors-review)*, and it hits exactly how you want a modern Vicious Rumors track to hit: sharp riffs, double-kick pressure, and a chorus that doesn’t beg for approval. It’s aggressive without being sloppy, melodic without going soft. That balance is harder to pull off than people admit—and plenty of bands fail at it.

 

Founder and guitarist Geoff Thorpe has never pretended this band exists for casual listeners, and that’s exactly why Vicious Rumors still matter. The song’s warped theme-park-from-hell concept fits the band’s long-standing approach—metal as confrontation, not comfort. If you want safe, algorithm-approved background noise, look elsewhere.

The video itself jumps locations across Germany, Sweden, Florida, and Kentucky, but the real point isn’t geography—it’s momentum. After tour delays caused by Thorpe’s shoulder injury, the band is clearly itching to get back in front of real crowds. And yes, this is one of those tours where “classics, deep cuts, and new material” actually means all three, not just code for the same five songs.

*The Devil’s Asylum* dropped last August via Steamhammer/SPV and stands as one of the band’s strongest modern-era releases. It’s lean, pissed off, and unapologetically metal. No gimmicks. No genre tourism.
