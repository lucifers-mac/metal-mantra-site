There’s no shortage of noise right now — rumors, wishlists, fake leaks, and “maybe next year” nonsense floating around metal social media. This list isn’t that. What you’re reading below is built on one rule only: **if the tour isn’t confirmed for 2026, it doesn’t belong here**. These are the shows metal fans can actually circle on a calendar, budget for, and lose sleep over. No speculation. No hype farming. Just the real tours that are coming — ranked by how hard they’re going to hit.

 

 	

 	**#10 – Ghost – Skeletour 2026**
Ghost’s 2026 North American dates are locked, and the machine keeps running flawlessly. Big rooms. Bigger production. Crowds that know every word. You don’t have to love it, but you can’t pretend it isn’t dominant. [Official site](https://ghost-official.com/) | [Tickets](https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fghost-tickets%2Fartist%2F1878819)

 

 	

 	**#9 – Judas Priest – Invincible Shield Tour (Extended)**
Judas Priest extending into 2026 feels almost defiant. Halford is still screaming, the band is still sharp, and the new material actually hits live. Legacy metal without the embarrassment. [Official site](https://www.judaspriest.com/) | [Tickets](https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fjudas-priest-tickets%2Fartist%2F807246)

 

 	

 	**#8 – Pantera – 2026 North American Dates**
The arguments are done. These rooms are full, the pits are violent, and the songs still land hard. Pantera’s 2026 dates are confirmed, and the momentum hasn’t dipped. [Pantera news & reviews](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/pantera/) | [Official site](https://pantera.com/) | [Tickets](https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fpantera-tickets%2Fartist%2F735820)

 

 	

 	**#7 – Slayer – Confirmed 2026 Reunion Shows**
Short runs. Massive crowds. Zero filler. Slayer’s confirmed 2026 appearances still feel dangerous, and that’s exactly why they matter more than most full tours. [Official site](https://www.slayer.net/) | [Tickets](https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dslayer)

 

 	

 	**#6 – Rockville / Aftershock / Louder Than Life 2026**
These festivals aren’t side attractions — they shape the entire North American metal touring year. Lineups drop, routing locks in, and the ripple effect hits every level of the scene.

 	**#5 – Metallica – M72 World Tour (2026 Dates)**
Metallica pushing M72 into 2026 keeps the juggernaut moving. No-repeat weekends, rotating support, and a stage that swallows stadiums whole. It’s a victory lap — but it still hits. [Metal Mantra M72 tour review](https://metal-mantra.com/metallica-m72-santa-clara-review/) | [Official site](https://www.metallica.com/) | [Tickets](https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dmetallica)

 

 	

 	**#4 – AC/DC – Power Up Tour (2026 Stadium Run)**
This isn’t nostalgia. It’s urgency. AC/DC’s 2026 stadium dates are confirmed, and every show feels like borrowed time. Riffs, cannons, bells — no filler. [Official site](https://www.acdc.com/) | [Tickets](https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dacdc)

 

 	

 	**#3 – Bring Me The Horizon – North American Arena Tour**
BMTH have fully crossed into arena-level metal dominance. The 2026 run locks it in: massive production, genre-spanning crowds, and a band that refuses to sit still. [BMTH coverage](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/bring-me-the-horizon/) | [Official site](https://www.bmthofficial.com/) | [Tickets](https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fbring-me-the-horizon-tickets%2Fartist%2F1153598)

 

 	

 	**#2 – Megadeth – 2026 North American Tour**
Megadeth this high isn’t nostalgia — it’s reality. The band is tight, aggressive, and locked in. Thrash without safety rails still matters. [Megadeth news](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/megadeth/) | [Official site](https://megadeth.com/) | [Tickets](https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fmegadeth-tickets%2Fartist%2F735627)

 

 	

 	**#1 – Iron Maiden – Run For Your Lives World Tour (50th Anniversary)**
Untouchable. Maiden’s 50th anniversary tour is confirmed for 2026, focused on the early years with classics and deep cuts stacked wall to wall. Giant Eddie. No debate. [Iron Maiden coverage](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/iron-maiden/) | [Official site](https://www.ironmaiden.com/) | [Tickets](https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Firon-maiden-tickets%2Fartist%2F735341)
