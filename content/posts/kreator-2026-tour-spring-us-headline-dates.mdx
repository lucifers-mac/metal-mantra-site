**Kreator 2026 tour plans are officially underway as the German thrash metal legends announce a Spring U.S. headline run with major festival appearances, marking the band’s first full U.S. run since their 2024 campaign.** The tour includes appearances at several of North America’s most high-profile heavy music festivals, including [Welcome to Rockville](https://metal-mantra.com/festivals/welcome-to-rockville/), [Sonic Temple](https://metal-mantra.com/festivals/sonic-temple/), and Maryland Deathfest, positioning the run as one of the most significant thrash-focused tours of the year. Tickets and tour roundups live on our [Tours & Tickets hub](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/).

The 2026 tour launches May 7 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and runs through May 23 in Huntington, New York, blending headline club dates with major festival stops. For a band whose legacy helped define extreme metal itself, the routing reflects Kreator’s continued relevance across both traditional thrash audiences and modern festival crowds. Tickets will be available via artist presale beginning Thursday, December 11 at 10am local time, with general onsale set for Friday, December 12 at 10am local time.

Kreator’s presence at **Welcome to Rockville** and **Sonic Temple** places them alongside some of the biggest names in contemporary heavy music, while their appearance at **Maryland Deathfest** reinforces the band’s deep-rooted credibility within the extreme metal underground. This dual positioning — mainstream festival stages and underground strongholds — has long been a defining trait of Kreator’s career.

The tour also supports the release of Kreator’s sixteenth full-length album, *Krushers Of The World*, due out January 16 via [Nuclear Blast Records](https://www.nuclearblast.com). The album arrives at a time when the band appear both reflective and ferocious, channeling decades of history into a release that refuses to soften its edges. Fans can [pre-order and pre-save the album here](https://kreator.bfan.link/krushers-of-the-world) and watch the video for the new single [“Satanic Anarchy”](https://youtu.be/rv9arEpXBLE?si=z-R_ctw0su7hIulQ).

Founded in the early 1980s in Essen, Germany, Kreator emerged from a bleak post-industrial environment where music served as both escape and confrontation. Drawing inspiration from the New Wave of British Heavy Metal and early American thrash pioneers such as Metallica, Slayer, and Exodus, the band quickly carved out a more aggressive, confrontational strain of thrash metal that would go on to influence generations of extreme musicians.

Over the decades, Kreator have not only survived but evolved, helping to radicalize thrash metal while inspiring artists across death metal, black metal, and beyond. Bands such as Arch Enemy, Cannibal Corpse, Behemoth, and even Ghost have cited Kreator’s influence, with Ghost’s Papa Emeritus famously joining the band onstage during a 2017 performance of “Satan Is Real.”

*Krushers Of The World* finds the band operating at full force. Tracks such as “Seven Serpents,” “Barbarian,” and “Deathscream” deliver relentless speed and aggression, while mid-tempo crushers like the title track and “Satanic Anarchy” showcase the band’s ability to balance groove with violence. Produced by Jens Bogren at Fascination Street Studios — who previously worked with Kreator on *Phantom Antichrist* and *Gods Of Violence* — the album sounds massive, sharp, and unapologetically modern.

Visually, the album also marks a notable evolution. Artwork duties were handled by acclaimed artist Zbigniew Bielak, known for his work with Ghost, who reinterprets classic Kreator visual motifs into a dense, occult-laden tapestry that pays homage to the band’s past while pushing their aesthetic forward. The result is a sleeve design that rewards close inspection and reinforces the album’s thematic weight.

As Kreator prepare to take *Krushers Of The World* on the road, the Spring 2026 tour stands as a reminder of the band’s enduring power. More than four decades into their career, Kreator remain a vital, intimidating force — equally at home leveling festival fields and demolishing packed clubs, still driven by the same uncompromising intensity that defined their earliest days.
