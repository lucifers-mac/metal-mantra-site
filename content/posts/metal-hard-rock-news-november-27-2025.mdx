The past day in heavy music hasn’t delivered many concrete announcements, yet the underground is alive with credible chatter and fast-shifting speculation. This edition of the Metal Mantra Rumor Watch takes a deeper dive into the conversations circulating across fanbases, insider groups, and active scene communities. None of these items are confirmed, but each represents the type of early movement that frequently precedes major developments. As the year closes out, the rumor mill is accelerating, and today’s signals feel louder than usual. Catch more in the [latest Rundown](https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/).

## Gojira Album Timeline Sparks Ongoing Speculation

Following **Joe Duplantier**’s hand surgery and the temporary addition of **Greg Kubacki** of Car Bomb for live duties, speculation around the next **Gojira** album cycle has intensified. Fans are openly questioning whether internal schedules have shifted behind the scenes, especially given the band’s reputation for deeply layered, detail-oriented studio work.

The band’s continued silence across official channels isn’t helping the uncertainty. Many followers believe the lack of communication signals something brewing rather than nothing happening at all. Whether that points to extended recovery time, additional writing sessions, or a strategic hold remains purely speculative.

## Slipknot Fans Expecting a Major Announcement

Slipknot’s digital footprint has shifted subtly but noticeably, and fans are treating it as smoke before fire. Small changes in member behavior, reduced downtime on socials, and a general uptick in behind-the-scenes activity have sparked theories ranging from lineup confirmations to a new era rollout. Even without official confirmation, the energy around the band feels markedly different from the usual quiet periods.

Long-time followers recognize the familiar tension that tends to rise just before the band unveils something significant. Whether that’s new music, a tour reveal, or branding for their next chapter, anticipation is building fast across the community.

## Growing Buzz Around Lorna Shore’s Next Release

**Lorna Shore** has entered one of their signature silent phases, which fans historically associate with the lead-up to major announcements. Their unpredictability has only amplified speculation, with conversations ranging from a surprise single to the early stages of a new album cycle. After their explosive recent run of success, the pressure and interest surrounding their next move are higher than ever.

The band’s fanbase is extremely active even during downtime, and this has created a feedback loop of excitement, theories, and heightened expectations. Until official word breaks, every small change in their digital presence is being scrutinized closely.

## Megadeth Farewell Tour Rumored to Expand

With **Megadeth**’s [Canadian farewell tour](https://www.megadeth.com/blogs/news/megadeth-to-embark-on-canadian-headline-tour-with-anthrax-exodus?srsltid=AfmBOopR009udwndc1z0tkKBMFp6V6r8fAMq4wadNbQSseQ1eZFyxXOM)—supported by **Anthrax** and **Exodus**—already generating massive demand, rumor threads suggest the band may add additional U.S. dates. Several major American markets absent from recent routing have been vocal about wanting a place on the tour, adding to the speculation that the current run may not be the final version.

Farewell tours often shift and expand in response to fan demand, and Megadeth’s history of adapting schedules makes the idea even more plausible. Fans are watching for any hint of expansion, especially in areas overdue for a visit.

## Amon Amarth European Routing May Grow

[as previously reported,](https://metal-mantra.com/metal-hard-rock-news-november-24-2025/) **Amon Amarth**’s 2026 European tour is shaping up to be one of the strongest ticket-moving lineups of the coming year. Early demand has already sparked discussions about extending the run into early 2027, possibly with a refreshed support roster. The band’s reputation for delivering massive, high-production shows has only amplified hopes among fans eager for additional dates.

The momentum surrounding the current tour package suggests that expansion is more than just wishful thinking. As pre-sales continue to move quickly across multiple markets, industry watchers are keeping a close eye on regions that traditionally sell out fastest.
