Monday hits with tour shifts, new music drops, and a festival lineup that keeps stacking. Here’s what matters right now.

## Burton C. Bell Won’t Sign His Final Fear Factory Album

Former Fear Factory vocalist Burton C. Bell said he won’t sign copies of *Aggression Continuum*, citing how the record was changed after his final involvement. It’s a rare case of a frontman drawing a hard line on a legacy release, and it underscores just how fractured that exit became. For longtime fans, it’s a reminder that the band’s last chapter wasn’t just a lineup change — it was a split with lasting tension.

## Beartooth Debut New Song “Free” Live

Beartooth premiered a new track, “Free,” during their Salt Lake City set, which is usually the first signal that a new cycle is moving from studio to stage. Live debuts like this aren’t just hype — they test how the material lands in a room. If the song stays in the set, it’s a strong indicator the release timeline is already mapped.

## Nothing Premiere “Never Come Never Morning” Video

Nothing dropped the “Never Come Never Morning” video, keeping their current run of releases active with another visual anchor. The band’s recent visuals have leaned into the same haze‑soaked atmosphere as the music, and this one stays in that lane. It’s a clean signal that their rollout is still building, not pausing between singles.

## Fallujah + Allegaeon Booked For 2026 Loud As Hell Festival

Fallujah and Allegaeon are confirmed for 2026’s Loud As Hell Festival, which immediately tilts the bill toward technical death metal. Pairing those two on the same lineup suggests the festival’s aiming for credibility with the tech crowd, not just broad heavy‑genre coverage. If you’re into precision‑heavy sets, this is an early marker worth tracking.

## Beyond Creation Premiere “Reverence” Video

Beyond Creation premiered the “Reverence” video, continuing their momentum with a fresh visual drop. For a band whose fanbase pays attention to detail, a new video isn’t just filler — it’s part of the cycle’s narrative. Expect this to be the anchor piece while they keep the next wave of content rolling.

## Pennywise Announce Spring 2026 West Coast Tour (w/ Circle Jerks, H2O, DFL)

Pennywise announced a Spring 2026 West Coast run with Circle Jerks, H2O, and DFL — a package built for old‑school pit energy and hard‑ticket loyalty. These are the kinds of lineups that sell fast in core punk markets because the overlap is real. If you’re on the fence, don’t wait for the last week — the rooms on these tours tend to tighten quickly.

## Alex Van Halen Plans Project With Steve Lukather Using Unreleased Eddie Material

Alex Van Halen revealed a new project with Steve Lukather built around unreleased Eddie Van Halen material. That’s not just archival talk — it implies there’s enough quality material to justify a full project, not a one‑off tribute. If this moves forward, it’ll be a major moment for the Van Halen legacy and a likely headline cycle on its own.
