    "content": "\nLouder Than Life 2026 is not a normal festival announcement. When Danny Wimmer Presents stacks Iron Maiden, Pantera, and Megadeth on a single Thursday night — with Pantera playing their only U.S. date of the entire year and Megadeth making one of their final farewell appearances — this stops being a festival and becomes something you have to defend skipping. Spread across four days, seven stages, and nearly 200 bands at the Kentucky Exposition Center in Louisville, the 2026 edition is the biggest bill in the event&#8217;s history and one of the most consequential festival lineups assembled in years.\n\n## Dates, Location & Headliners\n\nLouder Than Life 2026 runs **September 17–20** at the **Kentucky Exposition Center, Louisville, KY**. Four days. Seven stages. Here&#8217;s how the headliner schedule breaks down:\n\n**Thursday, September 17:** Iron Maiden, Pantera, Megadeth\n\n**Friday, September 18:** My Chemical Romance, Pierce The Veil, A Day to Remember\n\n**Saturday, September 19:** Limp Bizkit, Papa Roach, Sublime\n\n**Sunday, September 20:** TOOL, Gojira, Danny Elfman\n\nThursday night alone is the kind of bill that would sell out an arena tour. Iron Maiden headlining a festival that also has Pantera and Megadeth in the same night is a logistical nightmare for your neck and a once-in-a-career moment for your memory. If you want the full story on Maiden&#8217;s catalog and why they belong at the top of any bill they&#8217;re on, read our breakdown: [Iron Maiden Discography & Legacy](https://metal-mantra.com/iron-maiden-discography-legacy/).\n\nSunday closes with TOOL, Gojira, and Danny Elfman — a genuinely strange and perfectly assembled trifecta that rewards anyone who stays through the weekend.\n\n## Why 2026 Is Different\n\nEvery year has a hook. 2026 has several, and they&#8217;re not marketing fluff — they&#8217;re the kind of circumstances that define a festival edition long after the weekend ends.\n\n**Pantera&#8217;s only U.S. show of 2026.** One date. One stage. Louisville. That&#8217;s it for North America this year.\n\n**Megadeth farewell.** Louder Than Life is one of the band&#8217;s final farewell performances. This is not a standard tour stop — it is one of the last times you will see this band play.\n\n**Cavalera performing Sepultura&#8217;s *Roots* live.** Max and Igor Cavalera are playing the *Roots* album front to back — the first time in nearly a decade. That set alone belongs on a different stage in a different era, and it&#8217;s happening at Louder Than Life.\n\n**All-female-fronted stage on Saturday.** Halestorm, In This Moment, Lindsey Stirling, and Orianthi headline a dedicated stage — one of the more focused and genuinely stacked undercard bookings the festival has pulled off.\n\n**Reunion sets across the weekend.** Circa Survive, Get Scared, Blood For Blood, and Metal Church are all on the bill — bands that do not play together regularly and whose appearances here carry weight.\n\n**Mystery guests still TBA.** DWP has confirmed both a mystery guest and a &#8220;very special guest&#8221; that have not been announced. At this point in the bill, the bar for surprise is high.\n\n## Full Lineup Highlights\n\nNearly 200 bands across seven stages means the full lineup runs deep. Beyond the headliners, the bill pulls from multiple corners of the genre — classic thrash, post-hardcore, nu-metal, progressive, and crossover. Confirmed highlights include:\n\n**Metal and Thrash:** Iron Maiden, Pantera, Megadeth, Gojira, Cavalera (performing *Roots*), Metal Church, Blood For Blood\n\n**Rock and Alternative:** My Chemical Romance, Pierce The Veil, A Day to Remember, Papa Roach, Limp Bizkit, Sublime\n\n**Progressive and Experimental:** TOOL, Danny Elfman\n\n**All-Female-Fronted Stage:** Halestorm, In This Moment, Lindsey Stirling, Orianthi\n\n**Reunion and Special Sets:** Circa Survive, Get Scared, Metal Church\n\nThe remaining slots — and the mystery guests — fill in a bill that already justifies the price of admission several times over. If you&#8217;re tracking what else is happening in the 2026 festival circuit, see our guides on [Welcome to Rockville 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/welcome-to-rockville-2026/) and [Sonic Temple 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/sonic-temple-2026/).\n\n## Tickets\n\nTickets for Louder Than Life 2026 are available now via Ticketmaster. Single-day and multi-day passes are on sale, and given the scope of the headliner slate — particularly Thursday night — this is not a festival where you want to wait on pricing. Four-day passes let you see everything. Single days let you prioritize.\n\n**[Get Louder Than Life 2026 Tickets — Ticketmaster](https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Flouder-than-life-festival-tickets%2Fartist%2F2201109)**\n\nIf Pantera&#8217;s only U.S. show and a Megadeth farewell set aren&#8217;t enough to move you, nothing will. Thursday alone is the reason most people will be in Louisville in September.\n\n## More From Metal Mantra\n\n[Iron Maiden Discography & Legacy](https://metal-mantra.com/iron-maiden-discography-legacy/)\n\n[Welcome to Rockville 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/welcome-to-rockville-2026/)\n\n[Sonic Temple 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/sonic-temple-2026/)\n\n[Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/)\n",

    "title": "Metal &#038; Hard Rock News – February 27, 2026: Rob Zombie Drops, At the Gates Says Goodbye",
    "content": "\nFriday. New music day, and this one has weight. Rob Zombie drops a full album, At the Gates announces Tomas Lindberg&#8217;s final record, Lamb of God closes out their pre-album run, August Burns Red returns to Fearless, and Zakk Wylde finally has a date on the calendar.\n\n**Quick Actions:** [Browse active metal tours](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/) | [Past Rundowns](https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/)\n\n## Rob Zombie Releases *The Great Satan* — Out Now\n\n*The Great Satan* is out today via Nuclear Blast and landing well. Zombie&#8217;s eighth solo record is a 15-track industrial-horror-metal-cinema sprawl that marks the return of guitarist Riggs (his first since *The Sinister Urge*) and bassist Blasko (his first since *Educated Horses*). Nobody else is making records that sound like haunted drive-in theaters, and Zombie sounds locked in rather than coasting. Highlights include &#8220;Tarantula,&#8221; the swampy &#8220;Sir Lord Acid Wolfman,&#8221; and the closer &#8220;Grave Discontent,&#8221; which plays like the end credits of a 1970s giallo film. Pitchfork is mixed, but Pitchfork is always mixed on Rob Zombie — the metal press is calling it one of his strongest in over a decade.\n\n## At the Gates Announce *The Ghost of a Future Dead* — Tomas Lindberg&#8217;s Final Album\n\nAt the Gates have officially announced *The Ghost of a Future Dead*, due April 24 via Century Media. This is founding vocalist Tomas Lindberg&#8217;s final recorded work — completed more than two years ago, before his death in September 2025 from complications related to cancer treatment. Lindberg tracked his vocals in a single day, largely in one take, the day before major surgery. The first single &#8220;The Fever Mask&#8221; is out now with a video. The band describes the album as his legacy, and they&#8217;re not wrong. This is one of melodic death metal&#8217;s most important voices signing off on his own terms. Mark the date.\n\n## Lamb of God Drop &#8220;Blunt Force Blues&#8221; — Final Single Before *Into Oblivion* Drops March 13\n\nThe last preview track before *Into Oblivion* arrives March 13 via Epic Records, and &#8220;Blunt Force Blues&#8221; is one of the more grounded songs Lamb of God have released — rooted directly in the Richmond, Virginia scene that built them. The 10-track album was produced and mixed by longtime collaborator Josh Wilbur, and includes previously released singles &#8220;Parasocial Christ&#8221; and &#8220;Sepsis.&#8221; Pre-orders are live now with limited vinyl variants and a collectible CD edition bundled with a companion zine featuring album art sketches, handwritten lyrics, and unseen studio photos. To back the release, Lamb of God have organized a 140+ store independent record shop listening party series running March 13–15. A spring North American tour follows.\n\n## August Burns Red Return to Fearless Records, New Single &#8220;Behemoth&#8221; and North American Tour Announced\n\nLabel homecoming with teeth. August Burns Red have re-signed with Fearless Records — the label that launched them — and dropped new single &#8220;Behemoth&#8221; to mark the occasion. JB Brubaker calls it &#8220;one of the heaviest and most raw songs we&#8217;ve ever delivered,&#8221; describing it as a track about cutting ties with the past and refusing to let it occupy the present. The co-headline North American tour with The Amity Affliction kicks off April 10 in Worcester, MA and runs through May 17, with support from Boundaries and Heavensgate. Over 20 dates across the U.S. including Atlanta, Dallas, Phoenix, Anaheim, and more.\n\n## Zakk Wylde Confirms Black Label Society&#8217;s *Engines of Demolition* — March 27\n\nFour years in the making and finally dated. *Engines of Demolition* drops March 27 via Spinefarm, the follow-up to 2021&#8217;s *Doom Crew Inc.* Wylde began composing during the Pantera tribute touring cycle in 2022, and the constant road time kept pushing the finish line further out — but the record was completed in 2025. Wylde describes it as &#8220;a sincere ride through the peaks and valleys of the last four years, some of the highest highs and lowest lows and everything in between.&#8221; The BLS tour is already underway as of today, with lead single &#8220;Name in Blood&#8221; out now. The first studio album in nearly five years from one of metal&#8217;s most consistent workhorses.\n\nMore Metal Mantra: [Rundowns](https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/)\n\n**More from Metal Mantra:** [Headbangers Boat 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/headbangers-boat-2026/) | [Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/)\n",

    "content": "\nIf you spend any time in a car, at the gym, or on a plane, you already know that Audible is the move. What you might not know is how deep the metal catalog goes. Band biographies, oral histories, frontman memoirs — there is a legitimate library of heavy music storytelling sitting in there, and most of it is narrated by the people who lived it. Here are the ones worth your time.\n\nNew to Audible? Every title on this list is available on a free 30-day trial. [Start your free trial here](https://www.audible.com/search?keywords=metal+biography&#038;tag=metalmantra08-20) and you can grab one of these for nothing.\n\n### Mustaine: A Heavy Metal Memoir — Dave Mustaine\n\nThe definitive metal autobiography. Dave Mustaine covers everything — the Metallica years, the humiliating ouster, the descent into addiction, the Megadeth era, and the faith that pulled him back. It&#8217;s 11 hours and 38 minutes of the kind of honesty that most people in his position would never put on record. Narrated by Tom Wayland with over 1,100 ratings. This is the one you start with. [Listen on Audible](https://www.audible.com/search?keywords=Mustaine+A+Heavy+Metal+Memoir+Dave+Mustaine&#038;tag=metalmantra08-20)\n\n### Confess: The Autobiography — Rob Halford\n\nRob Halford narrates his own story, which already makes it required listening. The Metal God walks through five decades of Judas Priest, his 1998 public coming out, his battles with addiction, and what it means to have lived a life at the center of heavy metal culture. 13 hours, 1,458 ratings, narrated by the man himself. There is no better way to hear this story than in his voice. [Listen on Audible](https://www.audible.com/search?keywords=Confess+Rob+Halford+autobiography&#038;tag=metalmantra08-20)\n\n### Down with the System — Serj Tankian\n\nSystem of a Down&#8217;s frontman delivers something you would not expect from a metal memoir — a deeply political, philosophical, and genuinely moving account of growing up Armenian-American, building one of the most distinct bands in modern heavy music, and carrying the weight of genocide recognition as a public mission. Narrated by Tankian himself, almost 10 hours. One of the more surprising listens on this list. [Listen on Audible](https://www.audible.com/search?keywords=Down+with+the+System+Serj+Tankian&#038;tag=metalmantra08-20)\n\n### The First 21 — Nikki Sixx\n\nNikki Sixx already told the Mötley Crüe story in *The Dirt*. This one goes further back — the first 21 years of his life before any of that happened. The abuse, the abandonment, the desperation that drove him toward music in the first place. Narrated by Sixx himself, 5 hours 29 minutes. If you&#8217;ve read *The Dirt* and want to understand where he actually came from, this is the companion piece. [Listen on Audible](https://www.audible.com/search?keywords=The+First+21+Nikki+Sixx&#038;tag=metalmantra08-20)\n\n### Biblical: Rob Halford&#8217;s Heavy Metal Scriptures — Rob Halford\n\nLess memoir, more manifesto. Halford wrote this as a love letter to heavy metal — the culture, the fans, the history, and what it all means to the people who never grew out of it. 12 hours and 38 minutes, narrated by Halford himself again. If *Confess* is his life story, *Biblical* is his philosophy. Read them back to back. [Listen on Audible](https://www.audible.com/search?keywords=Biblical+Rob+Halford+Heavy+Metal+Scriptures&#038;tag=metalmantra08-20)\n\n### I Am Ozzy — Ozzy Osbourne\n\nOzzy narrates his own insanity across 12 hours — Black Sabbath, the bat, the dove, the Sharon years, the reality TV era, and the solo career that turned him into a solo legend in his own right. It is, predictably, hilarious and terrifying in equal measure. Required reading (or listening) for anyone who wants to understand how heavy metal became a cultural institution. [Listen on Audible](https://www.audible.com/search?keywords=I+Am+Ozzy+Osbourne&#038;tag=metalmantra08-20)\n\nEvery title above is available with a free 30-day Audible trial — meaning you can start one of these today for nothing.

    "content": "\nFlorida metalcore outfit Wage War have announced a new EP, *It Calls Me By Name*, due April 17 via Fearless Records. The five-track record is rooted hard in the band&#8217;s home state — described by the group as &#8220;shaped by Florida, the swamp, and the relentless aggression of nature.&#8221; If the lead single is any indication, this is the heaviest thing they&#8217;ve committed to tape.\n\nAlongside the announcement, Wage War dropped the video for &#8220;Song of the Swamp,&#8221; a track built on bloodthirsty screams, dense riffage, and percussion designed to make you feel like a speedbag. The band&#8217;s framing is simple: &#8220;The tone setter. Rooted in where we&#8217;re from. Driven by Florida and the raw aggression of nature.&#8221; It&#8217;s a hard turn toward straight metal, and it lands.\n\nThe full EP tracklist is: &#8220;Song of the Swamp,&#8221; &#8220;4&#215;4,&#8221; &#8220;Blindfold,&#8221; &#8220;Karma,&#8221; and &#8220;Purify.&#8221; The band says the collection isn&#8217;t a concept record but &#8220;is meant to live in its own world.&#8221; Pre-orders are open now via Fearless Records. Wage War joins a packed wave of [2026&#8217;s strongest touring metalcore acts](https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-metal-tours-coming-in-2026/), including names that have already staked out major runs across the year.\n\nTo support the release, Wage War will headline the &#8220;It Calls Me By Name Tour&#8221; with Nevertel and Orthodox in support — a 21-date run kicking off April 28 in Phoenix and closing May 31 in St. Petersburg, FL. The tour cuts through San Francisco, Chicago, New York, and Atlanta before ending on home turf.

    "title": "Metallica Announce &#8220;Life Burns Faster&#8221; Residency at the Sphere in Las Vegas — 8 Shows, October 2026",
    "content": "\nIt&#8217;s official. Metallica are taking over the Sphere in Las Vegas this October — the first metal band to ever play the venue. The **&#8220;Life Burns Faster&#8221;** residency runs eight shows across four weekends, continuing the No Repeat Weekend format that&#8217;s defined the M72 world tour since 2023. No two nights will share a setlist. That alone makes this more than a residency — it&#8217;s eight distinct Metallica shows inside the most technologically advanced concert venue on the planet.\n\n## What We Know About the Residency\n\nThe M72 tour has already played to more than four million fans across all seven continents since its spring 2023 launch, and it&#8217;s been universally regarded as one of the best production runs of Metallica&#8217;s career. The Sphere residency takes that momentum and drops it into a venue built specifically for immersive live experiences — the world&#8217;s highest-resolution LED display wrapping up, over, and around the audience, spatial audio that delivers studio-grade clarity to every seat, and multi-sensory 4D technology. Lars Ulrich has been talking about wanting to do this since he saw U2&#8217;s opening night in 2023. His quote says it all: &#8220;About 12 seconds into the opening night of Sphere with U2, I thought, &#8216;We have to do this.&#8217; This residency gives us another chance to reinvent how we interact with our fans in a live setting. Way fuckin&#8217; psyched to go next level.&#8221;\n\nThe Sphere has hosted U2, Eagles, Dead & Company, Phish, and No Doubt — but no metal band has touched it until now. Metallica being first isn&#8217;t just a milestone for the band. It&#8217;s a milestone for the genre. Heavy music in the most advanced live venue ever built, with a production team that&#8217;s already spent three years pushing the boundaries of what a stadium show can be. This is going to be something.\n\n## Ticket & Presale Info\n\nTickets go on general sale **March 6 at 10:00 AM PT**. Before that, there are two presale windows:\n\n**Travel & VIP Presale:** February 27 at 2:00 PM ET\n**Seated Registration Presale:** March 3 at 10:00 AM ET\n\nRegister for presale access and travel packages at [metallica.lnk.to/MetallicaSphere](https://metallica.lnk.to/MetallicaSphere).\n\n**Tickets:** [Get Metallica Sphere tickets on Ticketmaster](https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dmetallica%2Bsphere)\n\n## Metallica &#8220;Life Burns Faster&#8221; at Sphere — 2026 Dates\n\nOctober 1 (Thursday)\nOctober 3 (Saturday)\nOctober 15 (Thursday)\nOctober 17 (Saturday)\nOctober 22 (Thursday)\nOctober 24 (Saturday)\nOctober 29 (Thursday)\nOctober 31 (Saturday — Halloween)\n\nEach Thursday/Saturday pair features completely different setlists — no songs repeated across the weekend. If you can swing both nights, that&#8217;s the play.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nMetallica have spent 40 years playing every format imaginable — clubs, arenas, stadiums, festivals, Antarctica. The Sphere is the one venue that could genuinely offer them something they haven&#8217;t done before. The immersive tech, the spatial audio, the visual scale — this isn&#8217;t a band resting on legacy. This is a band that sold out stadiums for three straight years and decided the next move is to go somewhere that doesn&#8217;t even have a playbook yet. The [M72 tour already proved they&#8217;re operating at peak level](https://metal-mantra.com/metallica-m72-at-levis-stadium-santa-clara-review/). The Sphere residency is what happens when you take that energy and put it inside a building designed to amplify it in every direction.\n\nMark March 6 for general sale. These will move fast.\n\nMore Metal Mantra: [Metal Tours & Tickets Hub](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/) | [Top 10 Metal Tours in 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-metal-tours-coming-in-2026/)\n",

    "content": "\nDeath Angel are heading back out for the second leg of the **Act III U.S. Tour**, and they&#8217;re bringing Vio-lence and Incite along for the ride. The run kicks off **May 1 in Phoenix** and wraps **June 21 in Santa Cruz**, covering 35 dates across the country — including stops at Welcome To Rockville, Maryland Deathfest, and MKE Metal Fest.\n\nThe tour celebrates the **35th anniversary of *Act III*** with full-album performances every night. That&#8217;s not a greatest-hits set with one deep cut thrown in as a bonus — it&#8217;s the entire record, front to back, the way it was meant to be heard. For a band that came out of the Bay Area thrash scene and helped define its second wave, this is the kind of commitment that separates a real legacy tour from a nostalgia lap.\n\nVocalist Mark Osegueda said the first leg exceeded expectations: &#8220;Nightly we could see and even more-so hear it at every show. That you guys appreciated it beyond our wildest expectations.&#8221; The response was strong enough to warrant a second run — and this time the routing is deeper, hitting more mid-market rooms where thrash tours tend to hit hardest.\n\nPairing Death Angel with **Vio-lence** on the same bill is a Bay Area thrash double-header that doesn&#8217;t need a third name to sell it. Both bands came up in the same scene, and seeing them on the same stage in 2026 is the kind of package that rewards people who actually show up. **Incite** rounds out the bill with enough aggression to keep the energy locked in from doors to encore.\n\n**Tickets:** [Get Death Angel 2026 tour tickets](https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Ddeath%2Bangel)\n\nMore tour coverage: [Metal Tours & Tickets Hub](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/)\n\n## Death Angel 2026 Act III U.S. Tour Dates\n\nMay 1 — Phoenix, AZ — Marquee Theater\nMay 3 — Oklahoma City, OK — Diamond Ballroom\nMay 5 — New Orleans, LA — House of Blues\nMay 7 — Daytona, FL — Welcome To Rockville\nMay 10 — Charlotte, NC — The Underground\nMay 11 — Asheville, NC — Orange Peel\nMay 12 — Hobart, IN — Hobart Theater\nMay 14 — Detroit, MI — St. Andrews Hall\nMay 15 — Sayreville, NJ — Starland Ballroom\nMay 16 — Norwalk, CT — District Music Hall\nMay 19 — Wilmington, DE — The Queen\nMay 20 — New York, NY — Gramercy Theater\nMay 21 — Buffalo, NY — Electric City\nMay 22 — Allentown, PA — Archer Music Hall\nMay 24 — Baltimore, MD — Maryland Deathfest\nMay 27 — Atlanta, GA — Masquerade (Hell)\nMay 28 — Orlando, FL — The Abbey\nMay 29 — Ft.

    "title": "Metal &#038; Hard Rock News – February 25, 2026: Hall of Fame Nods, Ghost Hiatus, and Better Lovers Split",
    "content": "\nMidweek and the news cycle is swinging heavy. Iron Maiden is all over this one — Rock Hall nomination and a documentary in the same breath. A major vocalist exit, a Ghost pause nobody&#8217;s surprised by, and AI-generated garbage getting publicly torched. Here&#8217;s what actually matters today.\n\nQuick Actions: [Browse active metal tours](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/) | [Past Rundowns](https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/)\n\n## Iron Maiden and Black Crowes Among 2026 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Nominees\n\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame dropped its 2026 nominee list today, and Iron Maiden is finally on it. Seventeen artists total — including the Black Crowes, Oasis, Joy Division/New Order, Billy Idol, and a handful of pop names that&#8217;ll start arguments in every comment section on the internet. Ten of the nominees are first-timers. Maiden&#8217;s inclusion is long overdue for a band that&#8217;s been filling stadiums globally for five decades, and their 50th anniversary tour is still actively rolling. Fan voting is open now, inductees get announced in April, and the ceremony hits sometime this fall. If Maiden doesn&#8217;t get in this year after a Hall of Fame nomination, a documentary, and a world tour all running simultaneously, the institution has lost the plot entirely.\n\n## Iron Maiden&#8217;s &#8216;Burning Ambition&#8217; Documentary Hitting Theaters May 7\n\nSpeaking of Maiden — their five-decade story is getting a proper theatrical release. *Iron Maiden: Burning Ambition*, directed by Malcolm Venville, lands in cinemas May 7 for a limited run, with tickets going on sale March 18. The film features current and archival interviews with the band plus outside voices like Lars Ulrich, Chuck D, and actor Javier Bardem. Between this, the ongoing Run for Your Lives tour, and the newly announced EddFest two-day event at Knebworth this July — complete with an Eddie-themed museum and fairground rides — Maiden&#8217;s 50th year is turning into a full-scale campaign. Mark March 18 for tickets. Limited theatrical runs don&#8217;t stick around.\n\n## Better Lovers Part Ways With Greg Puciato\n\nBetter Lovers — the band that rose from the wreckage of Every Time I Die — announced they&#8217;re parting ways with vocalist Greg Puciato. The remaining four (Jordan Buckley, Will Putney, Stephen Micciche, Clayton Holyoak) say they&#8217;re finishing a new album and actively searching for a new singer. Puciato responded on Instagram with zero drama: &#8220;No bad blood. Everyone&#8217;s cool. Don&#8217;t speculate. Long live the frog.&#8221; He&#8217;s already locked into Jerry Cantrell&#8217;s live band and just reactivated The Black Queen for spring shows, so he&#8217;s not exactly sitting around. The split comes barely two years after their debut album *Highly Irresponsible*, which makes this a short but productive chapter. The real question now is whether Better Lovers can find a voice that matches what Puciato brought — or if this becomes a fundamentally different band.\n\n## Tobias Forge Says Ghost Will Go on Hiatus After the Skeletour\n\nTobias Forge confirmed what a lot of fans have been sensing — Ghost has nothing planned beyond the current Skeletá tour cycle. In an interview on Full Metal Jackie&#8217;s radio show, Forge was unusually candid about burnout after 15 years of building Ghost from the ground up. He compared his role to being a house builder who handles everything from permits to tiling, and admitted he&#8217;s run out of materials. He&#8217;s got two film projects in development and already recorded an album with a different project before this tour started, so he&#8217;s not disappearing. But for Ghost specifically, this is the first real pause since *Opus Eponymous*. The rare case where a frontman at the peak of momentum says &#8220;I&#8217;m actually fine if I lose it&#8221; — and sounds like he means it.\n\n## Philip Anselmo Shuts Down AI-Generated Health Rumors\n\nPantera frontman Philip Anselmo went on social media Tuesday to kill a round of fake AI-generated posts claiming he was battling blood cancer. His response was direct — it&#8217;s all bull. The whole thing was fabricated by AI content farms, and Anselmo made sure fans heard it from him before the rumor machine could run any further. This is becoming a recurring and genuinely dangerous problem across the music world as AI-generated misinformation gets more convincing and spreads faster than corrections can travel. If you saw those posts circulating, they were fake. Anselmo is fine. Pantera is still active. Don&#8217;t share garbage you can&#8217;t verify.\n\n## Voivod&#8217;s Denis &#8220;Snake&#8221; Bélanger&#8217;s Wife Battling Stage 4 Cancer — GoFundMe Launched\n\nVoivod have reached out to their fanbase for support after revealing that Christine McDonald, partner of frontman Denis &#8220;Snake&#8221; Bélanger, was diagnosed with Stage 4 colorectal cancer last October. The cancer has metastasized to her liver, ovary, and abdominal wall. Treatment is ongoing and showing some positive signs, but it&#8217;s intensive — daily injections, chemotherapy, and constant hospital visits. The financial strain has been severe, impacting both McDonald&#8217;s ability to work and Bélanger&#8217;s capacity to maintain his commitments with the band. A GoFundMe has been set up to help with medical costs and living expenses. If Voivod&#8217;s music has meant something to you over the last four decades, this is one of those moments where showing up matters more than sharing a post.\n\n## Tom Morello Postpones Solo Tour to Join Bruce Springsteen on the Road\n\nTom Morello has shelved his planned spring solo tour to hit the road with Bruce Springsteen instead. No elaborate explanation — when The Boss calls, you take the gig. Morello&#8217;s been a recurring presence in Springsteen&#8217;s live setup and the chemistry is well documented at this point. For fans who had tickets to the solo dates, the postponement stings, but the tradeoff is Morello playing to massive rooms with one of rock&#8217;s greatest live performers. Expect rescheduled solo dates once the Springsteen commitment wraps.\n\nMore Metal Mantra: [Rundowns](https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/)\n\n**More from Metal Mantra:** [Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/) | [Iron Maiden Discography &#038; Legacy](https://metal-mantra.com/iron-maiden-discography-legacy/)\n",

    "title": "SLAYER To Celebrate 40 Years Of Reign In Blood At Rocklahoma 2026",
    "content": "\nForty years after *Reign In Blood* rewired what thrash metal could be, Slayer is heading to Rocklahoma 2026 to mark the occasion. The announcement confirms the band will celebrate the landmark album&#8217;s 40th anniversary at the annual Oklahoma festival — a pairing that makes almost too much sense. Big outdoor stage. Hardcore crowd. One of the most visceral records in metal history. This is exactly where that celebration belongs.\n\n## Why Reign In Blood Still Matters 40 Years Later\n\n*Reign In Blood* dropped October 7, 1986 on Def American Records and immediately broke something in the metal world that hasn&#8217;t fully healed since. Twenty-nine minutes. Ten tracks. No filler, no breathing room, no compromise. From the opening blast of &#8220;Angel of Death&#8221; to the closing chaos of &#8220;Raining Blood,&#8221; the album operated like a machine designed to do one thing at maximum efficiency: destroy. It didn&#8217;t ease you in. It didn&#8217;t cool down. It just went.\n\nWhat Kerry King, Jeff Hanneman, Tom Araya, and Dave Lombardo built on that record wasn&#8217;t just fast — it was precise. The riffs weren&#8217;t chaos for its own sake. They were surgical. Lombardo&#8217;s double-bass work on tracks like &#8220;Piece by Piece&#8221; and &#8220;Criminally Insane&#8221; set a benchmark that thrash drummers are still chasing. Araya&#8217;s vocal delivery landed somewhere between preacher and executioner. And Hanneman&#8217;s writing gave the whole thing a thematic darkness that went beyond shock value into something genuinely unsettling.\n\nThe album didn&#8217;t just influence a generation. It defined a ceiling for how extreme mainstream metal could get — then dared everyone else to reach it. Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax — the rest of the Big Four had their own lanes. Slayer had a bunker. *Reign In Blood* was the ceiling, the floor, and the walls.\n\n**Pick up *Reign In Blood*:** [Get it on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Reign-Blood-Slayer/dp/B000002JDL?tag=metalmantra-20)\n\n## Rocklahoma 2026 — The Setting Fits\n\nRocklahoma has built its reputation as one of the premier outdoor rock and metal festivals in the US, drawing heavy crowds to Pryor, Oklahoma every September. It&#8217;s a festival that respects the genre&#8217;s history while keeping the live energy front and center — no pretension, no polish, just a massive field of people there for the music. That&#8217;s the right room for a Slayer anniversary set.\n\nThe 20th anniversary edition of Rocklahoma is stacking names — Godsmack headlines Friday, Papa Roach takes Saturday, and Slayer closes out Sunday with the *Reign In Blood* celebration. The undercard is deep too: Stone Temple Pilots, Black Label Society, Suicidal Tendencies, Dropkick Murphys, Pennywise, The Pretty Reckless, and dozens more. It&#8217;s one of the strongest festival bills of the year. If you&#8217;re tracking the 2026 festival circuit, this sits right alongside the [Louder Than Life lineup](https://metal-mantra.com/louder-than-life-2026-lineup-announced-iron-maiden-tool-pantera-mcr-nearly-200-bands/) and [Inkcarceration](https://metal-mantra.com/inkcarceration-2026-lineup/) as a must-watch.\n\nA 40th anniversary celebration of *Reign In Blood* is the kind of event that festival crowds show up early for. Whether that means a full album run, a career-spanning set that leans heavy on the classic era, or something in between, the context alone makes it appointment viewing. This isn&#8217;t nostalgia tourism. It&#8217;s a legitimate moment for one of metal&#8217;s most consequential records to get the stage treatment it deserves from the band that made it.\n\n## What To Expect\n\nSlayer performing in the context of a *Reign In Blood* anniversary raises the obvious question: are they playing it front to back? That format has worked for other legacy artists — [Death Angel is doing the same thing right now with *Act III*](https://metal-mantra.com/death-angel-act-iii-tour-2026/) — and it works especially well with *Reign In Blood* because the album functions as a complete statement.

    "title": "Mike Patton Hints at Quiet Closure for Faith No More’s Final Run",
    "content": "\nMike Patton is talking about Faith No More again, and the way he’s talking about it matters. In a recent interview, he described the band’s final run as carrying a sense of “closure” — not a headline‑grabbing breakup, but the kind of quiet understanding that sometimes settles in during the last shows of a long story. That framing doesn’t slam the door. It lets it stay cracked, which is exactly why this moment feels important.\n\nFor a band with a legacy this deep — and for a city like San Francisco that still feels their fingerprints on everything heavy and weird — even a soft hint of finality hits hard. But Faith No More have never been a neat, linear narrative. They’ve been a constellation: the record‑breaking highs, the long gaps, the reunion era, the one‑foot‑in‑the‑future restlessness. If this is the end, it deserves the full context. And if it isn’t, that context is exactly why the story still has fuel.\n\n## Faith No More didn’t just influence a scene — they rewired it\n\nFaith No More’s impact isn’t a footnote in alternative metal; it’s the foundation. Their 1989 breakthrough *The Real Thing* didn’t just put them on the map — it cracked the idea of what heavy music could be. It wasn’t purely thrash. It wasn’t purely rock. It was a collision: groove, funk, art‑school oddness, aggression, and the kind of theatrical tension that made everything feel dangerous.\n\nThen came *Angel Dust* in 1992 — a record that still confounds categories and is stronger now than it was when it first landed. That album is the DNA line for countless bands that followed. Nu‑metal, alternative metal, post‑hardcore, even modern metalcore and progressive scenes borrowed its blueprint: dynamic shifts, a fearless sense of arrangement, a refusal to be boxed in. When you hear bands that sound like they’re dragging multiple genres into one room and locking the door behind them, you’re hearing echoes of Faith No More.\n\nAnd it wasn’t just the genre blend. It was the attitude: no apologies, no script, no reason to conform. The band’s legacy is full of acts who became themselves because Faith No More already proved that “yourself” could be loud, surreal, and uncompromising. There are decades of bands who probably wouldn’t exist in their current form without Faith No More showing the pathway.\n\n## Bay Area roots, global impact\n\nSan Francisco isn’t just a backdrop in the Faith No More story — it’s the engine. This is a Bay Area band through and through, born out of a city that has always been willing to let the weird rise to the surface. The band’s early history lives in that regional mix of punk, metal, art, and experimental chaos that made Northern California a different kind of breeding ground. If you grew up around the scene, Faith No More weren’t “just a band.” They were proof that the local sound could go global without being diluted.\n\nThat Bay Area identity matters now more than ever because it anchors the legacy in place, not just in time. As the city continues to evolve, Faith No More remains one of the clearest cultural markers of what the area has contributed to heavy music: intelligence, risk, and a sense of individuality that still feels rare.\n\n## The Patton era and the long shadow of the catalogue\n\nMike Patton’s arrival didn’t just change the band’s sound — it expanded their vocabulary. His voice became an instrument of extremes: melodic and deranged, tender and violent, controlled and feral. That versatility didn’t just define the band’s peak; it set a bar for frontmen across the next three decades. If you’ve ever heard a vocalist snap from clean hooks to animalistic chaos in a single breath, you’ve heard a lineage that traces back to Patton.\n\nAlbums like *King for a Day… Fool for a Lifetime* and *Album of the Year* kept moving the target even as the industry around them kept trying to standardize what “alternative metal” meant. Faith No More never let that label stick. They kept mutating, even when it made them harder to market. And that stubborn refusal to simplify is why the catalogue still feels alive instead of dated.\n\n## The reunion era: not nostalgia, a second life\n\nWhen Faith No More reunited in 2009, it didn’t feel like a nostalgia lap. It felt like a second life. The band was vital on stage, and the return gave a newer generation the chance to see a blueprint band in real time. That era also led to *Sol Invictus* in 2015 — a record that proved they still had something to say beyond the shadow of their past.\n\nThat’s what makes the present so complicated. The reunion era wasn’t a simple reunion. It was its own chapter. It carried forward long enough to feel permanent, then paused in a way that felt unresolved. And now, with Patton describing a quiet sense of closure, the story sits in this tension between “finished” and “unfinished.”\n\n## Why the “closure” comment matters\n\nPatton’s recent comment about an “unspoken” sense of closure lands because it’s not dramatic — it’s honest. The last stretch of Faith No More shows felt significant even when they weren’t framed as a farewell. That’s a deeply human thing: you often realize a chapter is ending only after it’s already over.\n\n“I didn’t really think so at the time, but, yeah, maybe,”\n\n“And I think that we all kind of felt it, but it was unspoken.”\n\n“And it’s funny: when you’ve been in a band or a musical situation for a period of time, you always, in the back of your head, you’re kind of thinking, ‘Well, maybe this is it.’ And I don’t mind that feeling. I don’t see it as a sad thing. I see it as being present and being able to really appreciate it while it’s happening.”\n\nHe also reiterated something fans often forget: Faith No More was never a “main project” to him. It was one of many lanes he ran at full speed. That doesn’t diminish the band; it explains the operating system. If everything he does is equal, then nothing gets forced. And that means any return — if it happens — will be because it feels right, not because it’s expected.\n\n## The broader band context: friction, distance, and respect\n\nThe public record over the past few years has been clear enough: the 2021 tour was scrapped due to Patton’s mental health struggles, and the reunion momentum never fully recovered. Other members have acknowledged the strain and the uncertainty. None of that is shocking. It’s the reality of a band with decades of history, strong personalities, and the weight of expectation.\n\nBut there’s also something else in those interviews: a consistent respect for what the band already achieved. Even when the future sounds murky, there’s no sense of regret in the way they talk about what they built. That matters, because it keeps the story from feeling bitter. It keeps the legacy intact.\n\n## Why this story deserves a full feature now\n\nIf Faith No More are truly done, the importance isn’t just that a legendary band ends — it’s that a specific type of band ends. They’re one of the few acts that truly cut a new shape into heavy music, and their influence is so widespread that we often forget where it came from. From alternative metal to modern metalcore to genre‑agnostic heavy artists, their fingerprints are everywhere: dynamic song structures, left‑turn arrangements, and the confidence to be strange without apologizing for it.\n\nAnd for Metal Mantra, this is personal. Faith No More are a Bay Area institution. Their story is tied to the geography, the scene, the culture. Covering them isn’t just about documenting a band — it’s about documenting a piece of the city’s identity in heavy music.\n\n## The glimmer of hope\n\nStill, this doesn’t read like a final goodbye. Faith No More have always operated in cycles, not straight lines. They’ve gone silent and returned before. They’ve ended chapters and started new ones when no one expected it. Patton’s words sound like a man at peace with what was — not a man slamming the gate on what could be.\n\nSo this feature isn’t a eulogy. It’s a marker in the story. It’s a moment to acknowledge the weight of the legacy and the possibility that, one day, the band could decide to step back into the light for one more run — or even one more song.\n\nBecause with Faith No More, the end is never fully written until they write it themselves.\n\n*To be continued.*\n\nMore Metal Mantra: [News](https://metal-mantra.com/news/) | [Rundowns](https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/)\n",

    "content": "\nMonday hits with tour shifts, new music drops, and a festival lineup that keeps stacking. Here’s what matters right now.\n\n## Burton C. Bell Won’t Sign His Final Fear Factory Album\n\nFormer Fear Factory vocalist Burton C. Bell said he won’t sign copies of *Aggression Continuum*, citing how the record was changed after his final involvement. It’s a rare case of a frontman drawing a hard line on a legacy release, and it underscores just how fractured that exit became. For longtime fans, it’s a reminder that the band’s last chapter wasn’t just a lineup change — it was a split with lasting tension.\n\n## Beartooth Debut New Song “Free” Live\n\nBeartooth premiered a new track, “Free,” during their Salt Lake City set, which is usually the first signal that a new cycle is moving from studio to stage. Live debuts like this aren’t just hype — they test how the material lands in a room. If the song stays in the set, it’s a strong indicator the release timeline is already mapped.\n\n## Nothing Premiere “Never Come Never Morning” Video\n\nNothing dropped the “Never Come Never Morning” video, keeping their current run of releases active with another visual anchor. The band’s recent visuals have leaned into the same haze‑soaked atmosphere as the music, and this one stays in that lane. It’s a clean signal that their rollout is still building, not pausing between singles.\n\n## Fallujah + Allegaeon Booked For 2026 Loud As Hell Festival\n\nFallujah and Allegaeon are confirmed for 2026’s Loud As Hell Festival, which immediately tilts the bill toward technical death metal. Pairing those two on the same lineup suggests the festival’s aiming for credibility with the tech crowd, not just broad heavy‑genre coverage. If you’re into precision‑heavy sets, this is an early marker worth tracking.\n\n## Beyond Creation Premiere “Reverence” Video\n\nBeyond Creation premiered the “Reverence” video, continuing their momentum with a fresh visual drop. For a band whose fanbase pays attention to detail, a new video isn’t just filler — it’s part of the cycle’s narrative. Expect this to be the anchor piece while they keep the next wave of content rolling.\n\n## Pennywise Announce Spring 2026 West Coast Tour (w/ Circle Jerks, H2O, DFL)\n\nPennywise announced a Spring 2026 West Coast run with Circle Jerks, H2O, and DFL — a package built for old‑school pit energy and hard‑ticket loyalty. These are the kinds of lineups that sell fast in core punk markets because the overlap is real. If you’re on the fence, don’t wait for the last week — the rooms on these tours tend to tighten quickly.\n\n## Alex Van Halen Plans Project With Steve Lukather Using Unreleased Eddie Material\n\nAlex Van Halen revealed a new project with Steve Lukather built around unreleased Eddie Van Halen material. That’s not just archival talk — it implies there’s enough quality material to justify a full project, not a one‑off tribute. If this moves forward, it’ll be a major moment for the Van Halen legacy and a likely headline cycle on its own.\n\nMore Metal Mantra: [Tours & Tickets Hub](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/) | [News](https://metal-mantra.com/news/)\n\nTour links: [Metal Tours & Tickets Hub](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/) | Featured: [Amon Amarth + Dethklok tour](https://metal-mantra.com/amon-amarth-dethklok-tour/)\n",

    "content": "\nLouder Than Life has officially dropped its full 2026 lineup — and it’s the biggest bill in the festival’s history. The Danny Wimmer Presents flagship returns to the Kentucky Exposition Center in Louisville on September 17–20 with nearly 200 bands across seven stages. Headliners are locked, the undercard is stacked, and a mystery guest plus a major “very special guest” are still to come.\n\nThis is the kind of lineup that resets the fall festival calendar. Louder Than Life is already DWP’s loudest weekend, but this year’s booking leans harder into breadth: legacy headliners, modern arena draws, metalcore heat, and a deep bench of reunions and exclusives.\n\n## Louder Than Life 2026 — Dates, Location, Headliners\n\n**Sept. 17–20, 2026** • Kentucky Exposition Center • Louisville, KY\n\n**Thursday (Sept 17):** [Iron Maiden](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/iron-maiden/), [Pantera](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/pantera/), [Megadeth](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/megadeth/)\n\n**Friday (Sept 18):** My Chemical Romance, Pierce The Veil, A Day to Remember\n\n**Saturday (Sept 19):** Limp Bizkit, Papa Roach, Sublime\n\n**Sunday (Sept 20):** TOOL, Gojira, Danny Elfman\n\n## Why this year is a must\n\nLouder Than Life has always been a scene-wide crossover point — metal lifers, core kids, punk diehards, and hard-rock crowds sharing the same concrete. The 2026 bill pushes that idea further: a heavy legacy spine with a modern, stacked middle that makes the four days feel like a festival and not just a compilation of setlists.\n\n**Pantera’s only U.S. show of 2026**\n\n**One of Megadeth’s final farewell performances**\n\n**Danny Elfman’s first Eastern U.S. show in nearly a decade**\n\n**All‑female‑fronted stage (Saturday):** Halestorm, In This Moment, Lindsey Stirling, Orianthi, Icon For Hire, Kami Kehoe, Diamante\n\n**Reunion sets:** Circa Survive, Get Scared, Blood For Blood, Metal Church, Primer 55, Sent By Ravens, 40 Below Summer\n\n**Album anniversaries:** Jimmy Eat World (25 years of *Bleed American*), Sleeping With Sirens (15 years of *Let’s Cheers To This*), The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus (20 years of *Don’t You Fake It*), Alien Ant Farm (25 years of *ANThology*), Red (20 years of *End of Silence*)\n\n**Exclusive set:** Cavalera performing Sepultura’s *Roots* live for the first time in nearly a decade\n\n**Special performances:** Skillet’s pyrotechnic set, Chad Gray “30 Years of Madness” solo performance, Loathe exclusive Midwest appearance, Alissa White‑Gluz debuting a new band\n\nThere’s also a deeper festival story in this lineup: DWP is lining up a full-season arc.

    "content": "\nUK-based collective PRESIDENT have released the video for new single &#8220;Angel Wings,&#8221; their first track under Atlantic Records. It&#8217;s the most direct signal yet that PRESIDENT are building toward something larger — a mix of alt-rock, industrial texture, and programmed beats that sits at the heavier end of the band&#8217;s sonic range without fully crossing into metal territory. The band describes the song as exploring &#8220;spiritual redemption and the resolve to begin again,&#8221; and frames it as the opening of a new chapter.\n\n&#8220;Angel Wings&#8221; follows PRESIDENT&#8217;s 2025 debut EP *King of Terrors* and arrives as their first release for Atlantic Records. The band operates deliberately under a cloak of minimalism and anonymity — no press photos, controlled rollouts, no social noise — which has made each release land with more weight than the typical promo cycle. They told *Revolver* in a cover feature that they wanted to step back from &#8220;the conveyor belt&#8221; of modern music industry churn. The approach is working. Multi-million streams and a Revolver cover without having played a headline show yet.\n\nPRESIDENT are currently mid-tour opening for [Bad Omens](https://metal-mantra.com/review-left-for-good-bad-omens/) and Beartooth on a North American arena run through March 27. Remaining dates include TD Garden in Boston (March 11), Xfinity Mobile Arena in Philadelphia (March 13), Bridgestone Arena in Nashville (March 17), American Airlines Center in Dallas (March 19), and the Kia Forum in Inglewood (March 26). For a band still on their first EP, these are rooms that will do their reputation real work.

    "content": "\nThe midweek feed is heavy on tour movement, album rollouts, and one major lineup split. Here’s what matters right now.\n\n## At The Gates Preview New Album, Confirm Final Record With Tomas Lindberg\n\nAt The Gates have started teasing *The Ghost Of A Future Dead*, billed as their final album with Tomas Lindberg. For a band this foundational to melodic death metal, that immediately raises the stakes around this cycle. If this truly closes the Lindberg chapter, expect every single, visual, and live date tied to this record to carry added weight with longtime fans.\n\n## Exodus Drop “Goliath” Title Track, Album Lands March 20\n\nExodus just fired out the title track “Goliath,” with the full record due March 20. The early response is exactly what you’d expect: riff-first, no compromise, and built for pit conversion. With Napalm backing the release and a fresh content push underway, this looks like a core Q1/Q2 thrash anchor, not a one-off single cycle.\n\n## Mushroomhead + Fear Factory Announce Fall Co-Headline Run\n\nMushroomhead and Fear Factory are teaming up for the “Soul Of A New War Machine” U.S. tour with Nine Treasures in support. Stylistically, this package makes sense: industrial precision, groove impact, and a support act that adds flavor without derailing the tone. This is the type of co-headline run that tends to perform strongest in established hard-ticket markets where both fanbases overlap.\n\n## Converge Expand Spring Routing\n\nConverge added more dates to their April North American run around the Poison The Well shows. Expansion this late is usually a demand signal, not filler. It also points to confidence in market velocity for this package, especially in hardcore-forward regions where lineup credibility drives decisions fast.\n\n## Enter Shikari Lock East Coast Headline Dates\n\nEnter Shikari return this June with a focused East Coast stretch, including Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Toronto. Compact regional runs like this usually hit well when there’s demand but no bloated routing. If room sizes stay tight, several of these dates will move quickly once local pushes kick in.\n\n## Ingested Split With Vocalist Josh Davies\n\nIngested announced Josh Davies is out effective immediately, with Adam Mercer stepping in for touring duties. Any abrupt vocalist change creates real pressure on both communication and live execution in the next run of shows. This one will be watched closely for fan response as the band moves through upcoming dates.\n\n## Poison The Well Drop “Everything Hurts” Ahead of New LP\n\nPoison The Well released “Everything Hurts” from *Peace In Place*, their first new album since 2009. That gap alone makes this rollout one of the bigger comeback arcs in heavy music right now. If they keep this level of output consistency through release day, expect renewed catalog lift and strong nostalgia-plus-discovery engagement.\n\n## Shinedown Address Rock The Country Exit\n\nBrent Smith publicly addressed Shinedown’s decision to exit Kid Rock’s Rock The Country festival. Even outside strict metal lanes, this story is moving because it intersects artist positioning, promoter friction, and public narrative control. When bands step away from a major platform, the reasoning usually becomes part of the headline for weeks.\n\n## Lovebites Sign With Napalm, Push New Video\n\nLovebites have signed with Napalm Records and launched a new video tied to their current cycle. Label shifts like this usually signal a stronger global infrastructure push across distribution, press, and tour strategy. If the rollout stays disciplined, this can be a meaningful growth phase for their international profile this year.\n\nMore Metal Mantra: [Tours & Tickets Hub](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/) | [News](https://metal-mantra.com/news/)\n\nTour links: [Metal Tours & Tickets Hub](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/) | Featured: [Amon Amarth + Dethklok tour](https://metal-mantra.com/amon-amarth-dethklok-tour/)\n\n**More from Metal Mantra:** [Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/)\n",

The five-date run — celebrating 20 years of Adult Swim&#8217;s *Metalocalypse* — also hits Los Angeles, Seattle, and Portland. Special guests are to be announced.\n\nThe headline dates run parallel to [the already-announced Amonklok Conquest Tour](https://metal-mantra.com/amon-amarth-dethklok-tour/), the co-headlining run with Amon Amarth and Castle Rat that stretches April 15 through May 21 across arenas and major venues nationwide.

    "content": "\nBreaking Benjamin have announced a 30-date North American tour for fall 2026, running September 2 through October 24. Chevelle, Starset, and Kami Kehoe will support. Produced by Live Nation, it&#8217;s an amphitheater and arena run that opens at Freedom Mortgage Pavilion in Camden, NJ and closes at Jiffy Lube Live in Bristow, VA — with major stops in Denver, Las Vegas, Anaheim, and Fort Worth in between.\n\nThe band recently signed to BMG and dropped &#8220;Awaken,&#8221; their first new music in five years. It&#8217;s a direct statement of intent: Breaking Benjamin are not coasting on catalog. With ten number-one Active Rock singles and more than 8.5 billion combined streams worldwide, they have the history to fill rooms this size without a new album — but &#8220;Awaken&#8221; signals there&#8217;s more coming. The last studio full-length, *Aurora*, dropped in 2020 alongside the acoustic companion *Ember* (2018), which debuted at number three on the Billboard 200.\n\nChevelle on the support slot is the right call — two bands with compatible audiences and enough muscle to hold a room independently. Starset bring a different texture, more atmospheric and theatrical, which gives the run some range on the undercard.

The run moves through key East Coast markets early, into Canada, then through the Midwest, West Coast, Southwest, and the South before closing in Tennessee.\n\n## Ticket On-Sale Details\n\nArtist and Citi presales begin **Wednesday, February 18 at 12:00 p.m. local time** and end **Thursday, February 19 at 11:59 p.m. local time**. General on-sale starts **Friday, February 20 at 10:00 a.m. local time**.\n\n**Tickets:** [Get Poppy 2026 tickets](https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fpoppy-tickets%2Fartist%2F2186490)\n\nMore tour coverage: [Metal Tours & Tickets Hub](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/)\n\n## Poppy 2026 North American Tour Dates\n\nJuly 7 — Washington, DC — Echostage\n\nJuly 9 — Philadelphia, PA — The Fillmore Philadelphia\n\nJuly 10 — New York, NY — The Rooftop at Pier 17\n\nJuly 11 — Boston, MA — Roadrunner\n\nJuly 13 — Montreal, QC — MTELUS\n\nJuly 15 — Toronto, ON — HISTORY\n\nJuly 17 — Grand Rapids, MI — Belknap Park (Upheaval Festival)\n\nJuly 18 — Mansfield, OH — Ohio State Reformatory (Inkarceration Festival)\n\nJuly 19 — Detroit, MI — The Fillmore Detroit\n\nJuly 21 — Milwaukee, WI — The Rave/Eagles Club – The Eagles Ballroom Club Stage\n\nJuly 22 — Minneapolis, MN — The Fillmore Minneapolis\n\nJuly 24 — Chicago, IL — Riviera Theatre\n\nJuly 25 — St. Louis, MO — The Pageant\n\nJuly 27 — Omaha, NE — The Admiral\n\nJuly 29 — Denver, CO — Fillmore Auditorium\n\nJuly 31 — Salt Lake City, UT — The Union Event Center\n\nAugust 2 — Seattle, WA — Paramount Theatre\n\nAugust 3 — Portland, OR — Roseland Theater\n\nAugust 5 — Oakland, CA — Fox Theater\n\nAugust 7 — Los Angeles, CA — Hollywood Palladium\n\nAugust 8 — Phoenix, AZ — The Van Buren\n\nAugust 9 — Albuquerque, NM — Revel Entertainment Center\n\nAugust 11 — Austin, TX — Stubb’s Waller Creek Amphitheater\n\nAugust 12 — Dallas, TX — House of Blues\n\nAugust 13 — Houston, TX — House of Blues\n\nAugust 15 — Orlando, FL — Hard Rock Live Orlando\n\nAugust 16 — Atlanta, GA — Tabernacle\n\nAugust 18 — Charlotte, NC — The Fillmore Charlotte\n\nAugust 19 — Nashville, TN — Marathon Music Works\n\n## Why This Run Matters\n\nPoppy’s catalog has never stayed in one lane for long, and this tour reflects that same evolution in real time. The lineup pairing with Landmvrks and Thousand Below strengthens the full-show experience rather than treating support as an afterthought. You get a complete night that tracks with where heavy and alternative music are colliding in 2026.\n\nThe routing itself is efficient and built for momentum. There are no long dead zones, no obvious soft section in the middle, and no sign this is being treated like a casual run. For fans, that usually means one thing: if your market is on this list, lock your ticket early and don’t wait for resale regret.\n\nRelated coverage: [Evanescence 2026 World Tour](https://metal-mantra.com/evanescence-2026-world-tour/)\n\nFestival watch: [Rock for People 2026 updates](https://metal-mantra.com/rock-for-people-2026-halsey-final-headliner/)\n\n**More from Metal Mantra:** [Top 10 Metal Tracks of 2025](https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-metal-tracks-of-2025/)\n",

    "title": "Orbit Culture Drop Live Video for ‘The Storm’ as North American Tour Kicks Off Feb. 18",
    "content": "\nOrbit Culture just dropped a live video for fan favorite “The Storm” — and it’s not just a clip for the algorithm. It’s a document of the band’s last headline run, shot with a heavy focus on Gothenburg (close to home) and built to capture what their shows actually feel like when everything locks into place.\n\nAccording to the band, the video pulls them right back to a night that “carried real weight — intense, focused, and honest.” That’s the point: no narrative gymnastics, no extra mythology layered on top. Just a performance that hits hard, filmed like it matters.\n\nThe timing isn’t accidental. The band is about to kick off a North American run with Ov Sulfur and Atlas starting Feb. 18, and this is a clean way to remind people what they’re walking into. Orbit Culture have always lived in that space where groove and brutality shake hands — riffs that hit like modern thrash and death metal, with an industrial edge that keeps it moving even when the guitars are trying to crush everything in the room.\n\n“The Storm” is also another visual chapter tied to *Death Above Life*, the album the band released last October. If you missed that record the first time around, this is the kind of clip that makes the sell without sounding like a sales pitch. **Buy:** [Death Above Life (Orbit Culture) on Amazon](https://amzn.to/4qGmvcy). The band has described *Death Above Life* as a change and a reset — guitarist/vocalist/songwriter Niklas Karlsson called it “a big change for the better” and framed it as a rebirth. That’s dramatic language, sure, but the bigger point is simple: Orbit Culture aren’t playing it safe or recycling an older version of themselves. They’re trying to level up.\n\nIf you’re a riffs-first listener, that’s why this band keeps grabbing attention. They’re heavy, but they’re not lazy. There are hooks, there’s pacing, and there’s a sense that the band actually cares about dynamics instead of just maxing out distortion and calling it “crushing.”\n\n## Orbit Culture North American Tour Dates (with Ov Sulfur + Atlas)\n\n2/18 — Roseville, CA — Goldfield Trading Post\n\n2/19 — Portland, OR — Star Theater\n\n2/20 — Seattle, WA — El Corazon\n\n2/22 — Vancouver, BC — Rickshaw Theater\n\n2/24 — Calgary, AB — Palace Theatre\n\n2/25 — Edmonton, AB — Midway Music Hall\n\n2/27 — Saskatoon, SK — Louis’\n\n2/28 — Winnipeg, MB — Burton Cummings Theatre\n\n3/03 — Toronto, ON — Opera House\n\n3/05 — Montreal, QC — Beanfield Theatre\n\n3/06 — Ottawa, ON — The Bronson\n\n3/07 — Buffalo, NY — Electric City\n\n3/09 — Allentown, PA — Archer Music Hall\n\n3/10 — Silver Spring, MD — Fillmore Silver Spring\n\n3/11 — New York, NY — Gramercy Theater\n\n3/13 — New Haven, CT — Toad’s\n\n3/14 — Worcester, MA — Palladium\n\n3/16 — Cleveland, OH — House of Blues Cleveland\n\n3/17 — Pittsburgh, PA — Preserving Underground\n\n3/18 — Chicago, IL — House of Blues Chicago\n\n3/20 — Milwaukee, WI — The Rave II\n\n3/21 — Detroit, MI — El Club\n\n3/23 — Lexington, KY — Manchester Music Hall\n\n3/24 — Atlanta, GA — Masquerade\n\n3/25 — Charlotte, NC — The Underground\n\n3/27 — Orlando, FL — House of Blues Orlando\n\n3/28 — St. Petersburg, FL — Jannus Live\n\n3/30 — Houston, TX — House of Blues\n\n3/31 — Dallas, TX — The Echo Lounge & Music Hall\n\n4/01 — Oklahoma City, OK — Diamond Ballroom\n\n4/03 — Denver, CO — Gothic Theatre\n\n4/05 — Salt Lake City, UT — The Grand at The Complex\n\n4/06 — Las Vegas, NV — Brooklyn Bowl\n\n4/07 — Mesa, AZ — The Nile\n\n4/09 — Santa Ana, CA — The Observatory\n\n4/10 — Los Angeles, CA — Regent Theater\n\n**Tickets:** [Get Orbit Culture tickets (official listings)](https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3DOrbit%2520Culture)\n\n## What’s next\n\nOrbit Culture are also lined up for a heavy European festival summer (including Wacken and Bloodstock), and they’re slated to join Amon Amarth and Soilwork later in the year on a separate run. Bottom line: if you like your modern metal aggressive but still memorable, this band keeps earning the attention.\n\n**More Metal Mantra:** [News](https://metal-mantra.com/news/)\n",

    "content": "\nMonday is the cleanup day. The weekend doesn’t always deliver one giant headline — it delivers a pile of smaller ones that add up to the same thing: the machine keeps moving. Here’s what mattered, and what you can actually act on.\n\n**Quick Actions:** [Browse active metal tours](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/) | [Amon Amarth + Dethklok dates](https://metal-mantra.com/amon-amarth-dethklok-tour/) | [Avatar spring 2026 tickets](https://metal-mantra.com/avatar-spring-2026-tour/)\n\n## Nevermore Confirm 2026 Reunion Lineup, Sign With Reigning Phoenix Music, and Tease a New Album\n\nNevermore are officially back in motion with a full lineup announcement and a label signing — which is a lot more meaningful than the usual “new chapter” breadcrumb trail. Jeff Loomis and Van Williams are steering the reboot and they’ve brought in vocalist Berzan Onen, guitarist Jack Cattoi, bassist Semir Ozerkan, plus a new album in the works. That last part is the real tell: this isn’t just a nostalgia victory lap.\n\n## LOUDNESS Announce 45th‑Anniversary Dates (U.S., Japan, and Europe)\n\nLOUDNESS are celebrating 45 years with a run that hits the U.S. first (including a stop at Hell’s Heroes in Houston and a Whisky A Go Go date) before shifting into Japan and European festival appearances. If you’ve somehow never seen them, this is one of those “stop debating it” tours — you don’t get infinite chances with bands that helped build the lane in the first place.\n\n## W.A.S.P. Announce “1984 To Headless” 2026 North American Tour With KK’s Priest\n\nW.A.S.P. are packaging this run around their first four albums — the era that made them infamous and untouchable in the theatrical hard rock world. The “1984 To Headless” tour runs September 10 through October 31, with KK’s Priest as direct support. If you’re going, don’t overthink it. These kinds of nostalgia‑with‑teeth tours are exactly the ones people decide on late and then complain they missed.\n\n## Avatar Cut Their London Show Short After Crew Members Were Shocked On an Electrified Stage\n\nAvatar pulled the plug early on their Valentine’s Day London stop at Exhibition White City after an electrical issue turned the stage into a hazard. Johannes Eckerström said the stage became electrified, damaged gear, and severely shocked two crew members — and the band deemed the venue unsafe to continue. That’s the correct call. You don’t gamble with people’s safety so you can finish a setlist.\n\n## Castle Rat Add Two Headlining Shows Around the Amon Amarth + Dethklok Run\n\nCastle Rat are already on the big Amon Amarth + Dethklok tour, but they also added two standalone headliners: Grand Rapids (with Sacred Leather) and Anaheim (with Death Chant). The arena package is the spectacle. The headliners are where you catch a band while the room size is still human.\n\n## The HU + Apocalyptica Announce Spring 2026 U.S. Tour With The Rasmus\n\nThis is a clean “different flavors, same punch” bill: The HU’s Hunnu rock energy, Apocalyptica’s symphonic heaviness, and The Rasmus across the run. Dates start May 12 and wrap June 7 in Anaheim. If your city doesn’t get weird pairings often, this is one of the better ones 2026 is offering.\n\n## Warped Tour 2026 Keeps Stacking Names\n\nWarped’s rollout is doing what Warped always did: throw a ridiculous range of bands at the wall and let the crowd sort it out. Whether you love the genre whiplash or hate it, the lineup is big enough that most people will find something worth showing up for.\n\n**More Metal Mantra:** [Rundowns](https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/)\n\n**More from Metal Mantra:** [Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/)\n",

    "title": "Sabaton’s ‘The Tour To End All Tours’ Concert Film Hits Streaming",
    "content": "\nSabaton&#8217;s concert film *The Tour To End All Tours* has officially hit major streaming platforms, giving fans full access to the arena-scale production without waiting for another limited cinema run. The film was recorded during a sold-out show at the Ziggo Dome in Amsterdam, captured during the band&#8217;s massive 2023 European tour in support of *The War To End All Wars*.\n\n**Where to watch:** [Amazon Prime Video](https://www.primevideo.com/detail/0JK8GKYLMM9QH0Q0FL5GRDWM1H/) | [Apple TV](https://tv.apple.com/movie/sabaton-the-tour-to-end-all-tours/umc.cmc.52mox4l4c649955joni3ye2gn) | [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=sabaton+the+tour+to+end+all+tours&#038;sp=EgIQBA%25253D%25253D) (purchase/rental)\n\nThe setlist pulls from across Sabaton&#8217;s catalog, leaning heavy on the theatrical war-history anthems that pack arenas across Europe. Tracks from *The War To End All Wars* share space with long-standing live staples, and the Ziggo Dome production — pyro, LED walls, the full Sabaton stage rig — translates well to the screen. It&#8217;s not a stripped-down &#8220;we pointed a camera at the stage&#8221; situation. This is a proper concert film with multi-camera work and polished audio mixing.\n\nFor the band, the Amsterdam show carries personal weight. Sabaton has noted that their earliest Dutch shows drew a handful of people. Filming a sold-out Ziggo Dome — one of Europe&#8217;s premier indoor venues — for a global streaming release marks a &#8220;how it started vs. how it&#8217;s going&#8221; milestone that the film doesn&#8217;t shy away from acknowledging.\n\nThe film originally had a limited theatrical run through Trafalgar Releasing before landing on streaming. If you missed it in cinemas, the home release loses nothing in translation — this is a loud, visually dense production built for big speakers and a dark room.

    "content": "\nEva Under Fire aren’t interested in dressing things up for radio this time. The Detroit hard rock crew just unleashed a new single, “Murder Scene,” and it hits like a late-night spiral you can actually scream along to — big hooks, tightened riffs, and lyrics that stare straight into the mess most people try to hide. The track is out now via Better Noise Music, and if you want the full impact right away, the lyric video is here:\n\n*This post may contain affiliate links.*\n\n**Quick Actions:** [Get Eva Under Fire tickets](https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Feva-under-fire-tickets%2Fartist%2F2416865) | [Stream “Murder Scene”](https://evaunderfire.lnk.to/murderscene) | [Shop Eva Under Fire music](https://amzn.to/3OaQ8p6)\n\nIf the title hits close to home, you’re not alone — and that’s the point. “Murder Scene” isn’t trying to be inspirational wallpaper; it’s the sound of somebody dragging a real fight into the light and daring you to sing along anyway.\n\nOver at Metal Mantra, we love when a band swings for something that actually *means* something — and this one’s got teeth.\n\n[More Eva Under Fire coverage](/tag/eva-under-fire/)\n\nWhat makes “Murder Scene” land isn’t that it’s “heavy” in the press-release sense — it’s heavy in the lived-in sense. Vocalist Amanda Lyberg frames it as a fight with eating disorders, body dysmorphia, anxiety, and the kind of self-doubt that doesn’t get quieter just because you’re chasing a dream. In her words, it’s about “how dreams can become nightmares when the same people who once cheered for you are now criticizing you,” and the song sits right in that uncomfortable space where confidence and collapse trade places hourly.\n\nLyberg doesn’t play coy about it either: “The dream of being on stage comes with a spotlight on my personal flaws. I’m just a body. To be picked apart and judged and perceived… Anxiety is a liar in my head. It tells me I’m not good enough to be here. So, I fight it.” That’s the spine of “Murder Scene” — not a vague “empowerment” slogan, but the ugly, relentless loop you’re trying to break.\n\nIf you’d rather go straight to the audio, you can stream/download “Murder Scene” here: [https://evaunderfire.lnk.to/murderscene](https://evaunderfire.lnk.to/murderscene)\n\n## Where this fits in the Eva Under Fire arc\n\n“Murder Scene” is the follow-up to “Awakening,” the band’s previous single that arrived in October and marked their first new music in a couple years. If “Awakening” was the door cracking open, “Murder Scene” is the band stepping through it with their shoulders squared — more direct, more personal, and more willing to let the cracks show.\n\nYou can catch up on Eva Under Fire [here](https://amzn.to/3OaQ8p6)\n\nOne thing that’s easy to miss if you only see Eva Under Fire in headlines is that Lyberg isn’t just writing about trauma — she’s worked with it. She’s a practicing psychotherapist (trauma, grief/loss, addiction recovery), and you can feel that perspective in how these songs avoid the usual rock-script shortcuts. “Murder Scene” doesn’t posture — it documents the fight.\n\n## 2026 Tour Dates\n\nEva Under Fire are taking “Murder Scene” to the stage immediately, joining Jeris Johnson and Butcher Babies for a U.S. run starting February 8 in Portland. Later this summer, they’re also slated to appear as support (along with Cody Jinks) on select dates of Five Finger Death Punch’s 20th Anniversary World Tour 2026.\n\nTickets / links:\n\nTicketmaster tickets: [Get Eva Under Fire tickets](https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Feva-under-fire-tickets%2Fartist%2F2416865)\n\n### With Jeris Johnson + Butcher Babies\n\n2/8 — Portland, OR — Hawthorne Theatre\n\n2/11 — Salt Lake City, UT — Urban Lounge\n\n2/12 — Denver, CO — Bluebird Theatre\n\n2/13 — Oklahoma City, OK — 89th Street\n\n2/15 — Dallas, TX — Puzzles\n\n2/18 — Tampa, FL — The Orpheum\n\n2/20 — Orlando, FL — Conduit\n\n2/21 — Atlanta, GA — Smiths\n\n2/22 — Nashville, TN — The 58’\n\n2/25 — Washington, D.C. — Pearl Street (FREE SHOW)\n\n2/27 — Millersville, PA — Phantom Power\n\n2/28 — Frenchtown, NJ — Arties\n\n3/1 — Pittsburgh, PA — Jergel&#8217;s Rhythm Grille\n\n3/4 — Saginaw, MI — The Vault\n\n3/5 — Columbus, OH — A&R Bar\n\n3/6 — Chicago, IL — WC Social Club\n\n3/7 — Minneapolis, MN — Fine Line\n\n3/9 — Madison, WI — Majestic Theatre\n\n3/10 — Ft.

The band just dropped a new track, “**Citizen I.C.E.**,” a late-2025 rework of their 2005 cut “Citizen C.I.A.” — and they’re framing it as a direct response to what they called “Americans being executed in the street.” It’s blunt, ugly, and necessary.\n\nStream “Citizen I.C.E.” here: [https://dropkick-murphys.ffm.to/citizenice](https://dropkick-murphys.ffm.to/citizenice)\n\nAlong with the single, Dropkick Murphys are rolling out *New England Forever*, a 12” split LP with tourmates **Haywire**. Both bands contributed three originals and swapped covers — Haywire takes on Dropkick’s “The Boys Are Back,” and Dropkick returns the favor with Haywire’s “Always By My Side.” The physical vinyl is slated to be **available exclusively at shows** on the band’s *For The People…In The Pit* St. Patrick’s Day Tour.\n\nPre-save / info for *New England Forever*: [https://dropkick-murphys.ffm.to/newenglandforeverlp](https://dropkick-murphys.ffm.to/newenglandforeverlp)\n\n## Boston hometown shows: full support lineups announced\n\nAs the tour wraps, Dropkick Murphys’ annual St. Patrick’s Day week takeover in Boston is once again stacked — and it doubles as a **30th birthday celebration** for the band. Here’s the full rundown of the hometown shows and support acts:\n\n**Fri, March 13** — MGM Music Hall at Fenway — Dropkick Murphys, **Showcase Showdown**, **Haywire** & **Vigilantes**\n\n**Sat, March 14 (2:00 PM)** — MGM Music Hall at Fenway — Charity mini-concert (Dropkick Murphys)\n\n**Sat, March 14 (night)** — MGM Music Hall at Fenway — Dropkick Murphys, **Haywire** & **The Aggrolites** (**SOLD OUT**)\n\n**Sun, March 15** — MGM Music Hall at Fenway — Dropkick Murphys, **Unseen**, **Ducky Boys** & **Haywire**\n\n**Tue, March 17** — Citizens House of Blues — Dropkick Murphys, **The New Darkbuster**, **Reducers S.F.** & **Big Bad Bollocks** (**SOLD OUT**)\n\nThe run is the final stretch of the *For The People…In The Pit* U.S. tour (kicking off Feb. 9), with The Aggrolites and Haywire supporting on most dates — and the Boston weekend built as its own little scene reunion, pulling in hometown punk and street-level lifers alongside the usual globe-trotting DKM faithful.\n\nAll tour dates + tickets are here: [https://dropkickmurphys.com/tour/](https://dropkickmurphys.com/tour/)\n\n*Metal Mantra note:* whatever you think about “politics in punk,” Dropkick Murphys have been telling you exactly who they are for decades. “Citizen I.C.E.” isn’t subtle — it’s not trying to be — and that’s the whole point.\n\n###### More Metal Mantra tour coverage: [](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/)\n\n**Tickets:** [Get Dropkick Murphys 2026 tour tickets](https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Ddropkick%20murphys)\n\n**More Metal Mantra:** [Metallica Announce &#8220;Life Burns Faster&#8221; Residency at the Sphere in Las Vegas — 8 Shows, October 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/metallica-sphere-las-vegas-2026/) | [Death Angel Announce Act III 35th Anniversary Tour Leg 2 With Vio-lence + Incite — 35 U.S. Dates](https://metal-mantra.com/death-angel-act-iii-tour-2026/) | [Poppy Announces 2026 North American ‘Constantly Nowhere’ Tour With Landmvrks + Thousand Below](https://metal-mantra.com/poppy-2026-north-american-tour-dates/)\n\n**More from Metal Mantra:** [Headbangers Boat 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/headbangers-boat-2026-lineup/) | [Top 10 Metal Tracks of 2025](https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-metal-tracks-of-2025/)\n",

    "title": "Knocked Loose Feat. Denzel Curry — “Hive Mind”",
    "content": "\n[Knocked\nLoose](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/knocked-loose/) have never been a band that “tries something” just to prove\nthey can. Every pivot they’ve made since *Laugh Tracks* has\nfelt like the next logical escalation: tighter writing, uglier tones,\nmore negative space, and an even sharper sense for when to cut the\nfloor out from under you. “Hive Mind” keeps that trajectory intact —\nand the Denzel Curry feature doesn’t read like a label brainstorm or a\ncrossover-for-clicks move. It reads like two worlds that have been\norbiting the same aggression for years finally deciding to\ncollide. More reviews: [Review hub](https://metal-mantra.com/review/).\n\n## The Sound and the Impact\n\nMusically, “Hive Mind” hits like modern Knocked Loose should:\nblunt-force riffs, a drum sound that feels like it’s breaking the room\ninto smaller rooms, and those trademark stop-start dynamics are where\nthe band weaponizes silence as much as sound. The opening doesn’t\nwaste time with scene-courting atmosphere or “let’s build to the\nheavy.” It’s heavy immediately — not in the cartoonish “heaviest thing\never” marketing way, but in the real sense that the guitar tone is\nabrasive, the rhythm locks into that stomping, punitive pocket, and\neverything around it exists to make the next impact land harder.\n\nGarris remains one of the best frontmen in heavy music at making\nurgency feel physical. His delivery is still that serrated bark, but\nwhat makes it work is the phrasing: he doesn’t just ride the riff, he\nargues with it. The words feel shoved out of him, like the band is\ndragging him forward by the throat. That’s always been the Knocked\nLoose advantage — the songs aren’t just “angry,” they’re\n*activated*. You can hear it in how he paces lines against the\ngroove and how the band will pull back just enough to spotlight a\nhook, then slam the door.\n\n## Why the Feature Works (And Why It Doesn’t\nFeel Forced)\n\nThe Denzel Curry part is where this could’ve gone sideways, and it\ndoesn’t. The secret is that Curry doesn’t show up to cosplay hardcore.\nHe shows up like Denzel Curry: percussive, rhythmic, and fast enough\nto ride a beat that’s basically trying to throw him off. That’s the\ndifference — he’s not treating the feature like a novelty cameo. It’s\na performance that’s clearly written to *fit* the track’s\ntension.\n\nCrossover features in heavy music usually fail for one of two\nreasons: either the guest sounds like they’re pasted on top of a\nbacking track, or the band sands their own edges down to accommodate\nthe guest. “Hive Mind” avoids both. Knocked Loose doesn’t soften the\nmusic to create a “rap-friendly” moment; the band stays ugly and\nphysical. Curry, meanwhile, finds his lane inside that ugliness and\nmakes it feel natural — like the song had space carved out for him\nwithout losing any pressure.\n\nWhat “Hive Mind” does best is remind you that the\nmetal/hardcore/rap Venn diagram isn’t theoretical anymore. It’s how a\nlot of people actually listen. If you grew up on breakdowns\n*and* blast-your-car-subwoofers rap, this track doesn’t feel\nlike a fusion experiment. It feels like a statement of the obvious:\nintensity is intensity, and the only thing that matters is whether\nit’s convincing.\n\n## The Video: Real Places, Real Grit\n\nThe video is the right setting for Knocked Loose’s brand of\nclaustrophobic violence. They’ve always felt like a band that belongs\nin real places — basements, VFW halls, skate spots — not sterile\n“performance clip” sets that try to make heaviness look expensive.\nThere’s a grit to that choice that matches their whole ethos.\n\nZooming out: “Hive Mind” also lands as a smart next step after\n2024’s *You Won’t Go Before You’re Supposed To*. That record\nwidened their spotlight without turning them into a different band,\nand a feature like this capitalizes on that momentum without feeling\nlike a surrender to it. If anything, it’s a flex: we’re bigger now,\nand we’re using that reach to make heavier swings.\n\nIf there’s a knock against “Hive Mind,” it’s that Knocked Loose are\nnow so consistent at delivering this level of controlled brutality\nthat the shock factor isn’t what it was when they first started\npushing their sound into more jagged territory. But that’s not a real\nproblem — it’s what happens when you become the benchmark. The real\nquestion is whether the song sticks, and between the pacing, the\nfeature, and the inherent replay value of that rhythmic violence, this\none has legs.\n\n## Final Take\n\n**Verdict:** “Hive Mind” is a legit collaboration, not\na marketing stunt — and it keeps Knocked Loose right where they’ve\nbeen living: at the front of modern heavy music, dragging the rest of\nthe scene forward by sheer force.\n\nKnocked Loose: [official site](https://knockedloose.com/)\n\n**More on Metal Mantra:**\n\n[Knocked Loose\ncoverage](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/knocked-loose/)\n\n[Hardcore coverage](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/hardcore/)\n\n[Metalcore coverage](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/metalcore/)\n\n[ShipRocked\n2026 Review (Knocked Loose live context)](https://metal-mantra.com/shiprocked-2026-review-metal-cruise-dead-poet-society-knocked-loose/)\n\n**Support via affiliate:** Knocked Loose — *You\nWon’t Go Before You’re Supposed To*: [Amazon](https://amzn.to/4alImzR)\n\n**Knocked Loose on Amazon:** [Shop Knocked Loose](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Knocked+Loose+vinyl&#038;tag=metalmantra-20)\n\nRelated: [Rock for People Adds Knocked Loose, Saxon, Alexisonfire to Iron Maiden Day](https://metal-mantra.com/rock-for-people-2026-iron-maiden-knocked-loose/)\n\nMore Metal Mantra: [Rundowns](https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/) | [Metal Tours](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/)\n\n**More from Metal Mantra:** [Iron Maiden Discography &#038; Legacy](https://metal-mantra.com/iron-maiden-discography-legacy/)\n",

    "content": "\n### Metal & Hard Rock News – February 6, 2026: Dickinson&#8217;s Solo Return, Global Tour Announcements, and Health-First Decisions\n\nThe metal world is firing on all cylinders as February rolls forward, delivering a concentrated burst of tour announcements spanning three continents, studio updates from iconic frontmen, and critical health decisions from veteran performers. From Bruce Dickinson&#8217;s analog recording sessions with Sepultura members at Dave Grohl&#8217;s legendary Studio 606 to a stacked summer metalcore package tearing through the United States, today&#8217;s developments prove the heavy music ecosystem remains as active and globe-spanning as ever, with established legends and rising forces alike commanding attention across multiple territories and subgenres. Catch more in the [latest Rundown](https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/).\n\n **Bruce Dickinson** is currently deep in the tracking process for his next solo album at Dave Grohl&#8217;s renowned Studio 606, working alongside members of Sepultura and capturing performances live in the room using traditional analog methods that prioritize organic energy over digital precision. Once the recording wraps, the Iron Maiden vocalist will rejoin his legendary band for the massive 2026 &#8220;Run For Your Lives&#8221; tour, which will see the metal institution storming through Europe and the Americas with what promises to be one of the year&#8217;s most ambitious heavy music productions.\n\n **Fear Factory** has confirmed a May 2026 tour across Australia and New Zealand, finally bringing their mechanized, groove-laden industrial metal assault to the Southern Hemisphere with confirmed stops in Perth, Adelaide, and additional cities throughout both countries. This marks a significant moment for the revitalized outfit, as their punishing blend of mechanical precision and crushing heaviness will reach fans who have waited years for the band to make the journey Down Under, cementing Fear Factory&#8217;s commitment to global touring despite past internal turbulence.\n\n **Mastodon** just unveiled a comprehensive European tour scheduled for summer 2026, with rising British metalcore act Loathe confirmed as direct support across multiple countries throughout the run. The Atlanta sludge metal titans will flex their progressive muscle and technical prowess across the continent, delivering their signature blend of complex arrangements and crushing riffs to audiences from Scandinavia to Southern Europe in what stands as one of the season&#8217;s most anticipated heavy music pairings.\n\n **Motionless In White** dropped a bombshell summer tour announcement featuring a stacked bill that includes deathcore powerhouse Lorna Shore, metalcore mainstays Fit For A King, and rising UK post-hardcore outfit Static Dress, creating what may be the most potent metalcore package of the 2026 touring season. The multi-city United States run will showcase the full spectrum of modern heavy music, from theatrical gothic metal to technical brutality, giving fans across the country a comprehensive look at the current state of metalcore&#8217;s evolution and commercial reach,\n\n **Poison the Well** is making the journey to Australia this June, bringing their influential blend of metallic hardcore and emotional intensity to the continent with support from local act Haywire on select dates. The Florida legends, who helped define the intersection of hardcore aggression and melodic sensibility in the early 2000s, will fly the flag for American metalcore internationally, proving their continued relevance and drawing power nearly three decades into their career.\n\n **Maul** announced a headlining United States tour scheduled for March 2026, bringing their punishing death metal barrage to cities spanning from Wisconsin through Texas and hitting multiple regions in between. The North Dakota death metal outfit continues building momentum behind their crushing riff-driven approach, demonstrating that underground extreme metal still commands dedicated audiences willing to pack venues for uncompromising brutality delivered with technical precision and old-school intensity.\n\n **New Music Releases** flooded the zone over the past 48 hours, with Transilvania unleashing &#8220;Set The Tombs On Fire&#8221; alongside accompanying visual content, while Cyclone, Tailgunner, and Sister Sin also dropped fresh singles and music videos that span multiple subgenres from traditional heavy metal to modern aggression. This simultaneous release barrage demonstrates the constant content flow that defines contemporary metal culture, where established acts and emerging forces alike maintain visibility through regular single drops and visual media that keep fans engaged between album cycles and tour announcements.\n\n **Blaze Bayley** made the difficult but necessary decision to permanently eliminate traditional meet-and-greet sessions from his touring schedule, prioritizing his long-term health and recovery following a serious cardiac event that required immediate medical intervention. The former Iron Maiden vocalist will continue performing live shows and connecting with audiences through his music, but the physical and time demands of post-show autograph sessions and extended fan interactions have been removed from his professional obligations, reflecting a growing awareness among aging metal musicians about sustainable career management and the importance of health maintenance over fan service expectations.\n\nMore from this cycle: [Iron Maiden 2026 tour coverage](https://metal-mantra.com/iron-maiden-2026-run-for-your-lives-tour/) | [Metal Tours & Tickets Hub](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/)\n\n**More from Metal Mantra:** [Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/) | [Iron Maiden Discography &#038; Legacy](https://metal-mantra.com/iron-maiden-discography-legacy/)\n",

    "content": "\n**Rock for People** just loaded up their special [Iron Maiden](/tag/iron-maiden/) day with enough firepower to justify the hype. [Knocked Loose](/tag/knocked-loose/), **Saxon**, **Alexisonfire**, and **Man With A Mission** are all confirmed for Sunday, June 14, 2026 — the fifth and final day of the [Czech festival](https://metal-mantra.com/rock-for-people-2026-announces-massive-lineup-featuring-iron-maiden-bring-me-the-horizon-papa-roach-electric-callboy-2/) that&#8217;s become one of Europe&#8217;s better-curated hard music gatherings at Park 360 in Hradec Králové. We&#8217;ll keep updates rolling in our [Rock for People 2026 coverage](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/rock-for-people-2026/).\n\n[Buy Rock for People 2026 passes now](https://rockforpeople.cz/en/tickets/) (capacity is moving fast).\n\nThis isn&#8217;t just padding around a headliner. Saxon brings legitimate NWOBHM pedigree — these guys were charting when most of us weren&#8217;t born, with classics like &#8220;Wheels of Steel&#8221; and &#8220;Denim and Leather&#8221; defining early 80s metal. If you want to revisit the classics before the festival, grab [Saxon&#8217;s Wheels of Steel](https://amzn.to/3NXPkDS) on vinyl. Their 50-year career proves they&#8217;ve earned their spot on any bill with Maiden.\n\nKnocked Loose represents everything heavy that matters right now. That Grammy nomination for Best Metal Performance proved hardcore finally broke through the mainstream&#8217;s bullshit gate, and their chaotic live shows have been obliterating festivals worldwide. We just covered their absolute destruction at ShipRocked 2026, where they turned the cruise into a floating mosh pit — [read our full cruise review here](https://metal-mantra.com/shiprocked-2026-review-metal-cruise-dead-poet-society-knocked-loose/) to see what Rock for People is in for.\n\nAlexisonfire brings that mid-2000s post-hardcore energy that still resonates. The Canadian quintet&#8217;s combination of screamo intensity and melodic hooks influenced an entire generation of bands, and their recent reunion shows they haven&#8217;t lost a step. Man With A Mission rounds out the bill with their anime-inspired rock theatrics — they&#8217;re genuinely fun in a scene that takes itself too seriously sometimes, and their return after Rock for People 2023 shows the festival knows what works.\n\nFestival director Luděk Motyčka says they built a &#8220;dramaturgically thought-out day&#8221; — which is just fancy talk for saying they actually gave a shit about booking bands that make sense together. It shows. You&#8217;re getting metal legends alongside the bands reshaping heavy music in 2026, all building toward Maiden&#8217;s inevitable two-hour assault.\n\n## The Iron Maiden Day Caps a Stacked Five-Day Festival\n\nThe Maiden-anchored Sunday isn&#8217;t happening in a vacuum. Rock for People 2026 runs June 10-14 with one of the most eclectic lineups the Czech festival has ever assembled. Wednesday kicks off with **Gorillaz**, **Electric Callboy**, [Megadeth](/tag/megadeth/), and **Trivium**. Thursday brings [Limp Bizkit](/tag/limp-bizkit/), **Papa Roach**, and **BABYMETAL**. Friday sees [Bring Me The Horizon](/tag/bring-me-the-horizon/) headline alongside **A Day To Remember** and **Tom Morello**. Saturday closes with **Halsey**, **Within Temptation**, and **Nothing But Thieves**.\n\nIt&#8217;s the kind of booking strategy that works because they&#8217;re not trying to be Download or Wacken — Rock for People has always lived in the space where rock, metal, and alternative overlap without apology. The festival has built its reputation over two decades by taking chances on diverse lineups that somehow make perfect sense when you&#8217;re actually there. The Maiden day just takes that philosophy and dials it to eleven with a focused heavy music lineup that actually respects the headliner&#8217;s legacy instead of throwing random acts on the bill.\n\n## Grandstands, Beer, and Selling Out Fast\n\n[Rock for People](https://rockforpeople.cz/en) is adding seated grandstands at the main stage for 490 CZK (about $21 USD) as a ticket upgrade to any festival pass. Not a bad call if you want guaranteed sightlines for Maiden&#8217;s two-hour set without fighting for barrier position all day. The grandstand setup is new for 2026, addressing one of the few complaints about the festival&#8217;s otherwise excellent facilities at Park 360.\n\nWant to prep for the show? [Pick up some Iron Maiden vinyl](https://amzn.to/46AqBf3) before you head to Prague. Die-hards can also hit up an Iron Maiden Trooper beer tasting and special wine experience, because apparently Bruce Dickinson&#8217;s beverage empire is taking over the festival grounds. Honestly, if you&#8217;re going to get hammered at a metal festival, might as well do it with the headliner&#8217;s branded alcohol.\n\n**Tickets are moving fast** — over 80% of capacity is already gone, which is unusual for February. The Iron Maiden announcement clearly lit a fire under ticket sales. If you&#8217;re planning to make the trip to Park 360 in Hradec Králové, Czechia, grab tickets [directly from Rock for People](https://rockforpeople.cz/en/tickets/) before this thing sells out completely. Multi-day passes start around $345, with single-day tickets for the Iron Maiden Sunday expected to be announced soon.\n\n### Fan Extras\n\n[Saxon – Wheels of Steel (vinyl)](https://amzn.to/3NXPkDS) | [Iron Maiden vinyl picks](https://amzn.to/46AqBf3)\n\nRelated: [Knocked Loose Feat.

    "title": "ShipRocked 2026 Review: Six Days of Metal Chaos at Sea",
    "content": "\nI just spent six days on the Carnival Horizon with some of the heaviest bands in modern metal, and I&#8217;m still processing what the hell just happened. We&#8217;ll keep updates rolling in our [ShipRocked coverage](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/shiprocked/).\n\nThis was my third [ShipRocked](https://www.shiprocked.com/)—Triple Threat status, for those keeping track—but it was my first time covering it as **Metal Mantra**. The first two times, I was just another metalhead on the ship, soaking it all in. This year? I brought you all with me, and ShipRocked 2026 delivered in ways I wasn&#8217;t expecting.\n\nThe lineup was stacked: Knocked Loose, Halestorm, Motionless In White, Wage War, Avatar, and dozens more across six days at sea. But here&#8217;s what no press release will tell you—ShipRocked isn&#8217;t just about the bands. It&#8217;s about being trapped on a floating metal festival with nowhere to escape, where the band you just watched destroys a stage set wanders over to watch the next act right next to you. It&#8217;s chaos, community, and catharsis all at once.\n\n### **The Performances That Mattered**\n\n**[Dead Poet Society](/tag/dead-poet-society/) owned this cruise.** They played two sets—one in the ship&#8217;s theater and one on the Lido Deck—and both were absolutely flawless. Jack Underkofler has the best voice I heard all week, and that&#8217;s saying something when you&#8217;re sharing a boat with some of the biggest names in modern metal. The theater set had that intimate, dialed-in energy where every note hit perfectly. The deck set brought the chaos. Between setlist choices, stage presence, and sound quality, DPS was firing on all cylinders. If you slept on them, you missed out. [Check out their latest album on vinyl](https://amzn.to/4two6Vc).\n\n**[House of Protection](/tag/house-of-protection/) brought pure, unfiltered chaos** to the Lido Deck in the best way possible. Their set was messy, fun, and exactly what an outdoor metal cruise performance should be. No pretense, just raw energy and a crowd that fed off it. These are the kind of sets that make ShipRocked special—bands that understand the assignment and lean into the absurdity of playing heavy music on a cruise ship.\n\n**[Wage War](/tag/wage-war/)&#8216;s opening night set was a cathartic release.** They came out swinging on the first night and reminded everyone why they&#8217;re one of the best live [metalcore](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/metalcore/) acts right now. Tight, heavy, and emotionally charged. The set built the energy that would define the rest of the week, and Wage War delivered exactly what the crowd needed to kick things off right. Catch them on tour—grab tickets here.\n\n**[Knocked Loose](/tag/knocked-loose/) tried to sink the boat.** I&#8217;m not exaggerating. You&#8217;re technically not allowed to mosh or crowd surf on ShipRocked for safety reasons, and that rule lasted approximately five minutes into Knocked Loose&#8217;s first set before the entire front section erupted. I was on the rail for this one, and Shield Security deserves an award for catching surfer after surfer while somehow keeping everyone safe and smiling. The crowd was the most insane I&#8217;ve seen in three years of ShipRocked. Bryan Garris and the crew knew exactly what they were doing, and they did it anyway. Respect. [Grab their latest album here](https://amzn.to/3Zgx2jC).\n\n**[The Funeral Portrait](/tag/the-funeral-portrait/)** might have been my favorite surprise of the cruise. You could tell being on ShipRocked meant everything to them. Lee Jennings was everywhere—taking photos, talking to fans, genuinely having the time of his life—and that energy came through in their performances. When a band is that visibly stoked to be there, the crowd feels it. Their sets were proof that ShipRocked isn&#8217;t just about the biggest names on the lineup; it&#8217;s about bands that understand what this experience means to the metal community.\n\n**[Holy Wars](/tag/holy-wars/) stepped up huge.** I&#8217;d seen them before, so maybe I should have expected it, but they raised their game on this cruise. They were a massive standout, and they spent an absurd amount of time talking to me and my travel partner between sets. Every time I ran into them after that, they&#8217;d stop to say what&#8217;s up or throw a smile. That&#8217;s the ShipRocked difference—the bands are accessible in ways they never are at land festivals.\n\n### **The Moments Between the Chaos**\n\nKaraoke is always a ShipRocked highlight, and this year didn&#8217;t disappoint. Eric Vanlerberghe from I Prevail singing karaoke at 3 in the morning is exactly the kind of moment that only happens on a metal cruise. No stage, no production, just a dude from one of the biggest metalcore bands having fun with the crowd.\n\nThen there was **The Stowaways**—an all-star cover band made up of musicians from other acts on the lineup—who had both their sets scheduled for the Lido Deck. Friday night&#8217;s second performance got cancelled due to a storm rolling in, but the show must go on. The entire crew and tech staff busted their asses to get the Ocean Plaza stage ready in record time, making sure the music didn&#8217;t stop just because Mother Nature had other plans.\n\n**[Jay Howell](https://www.instagram.com/punksgitcut/)** deserves his own paragraph. The animator and character designer behind Nickelodeon&#8217;s *Sanjay and Craig* and Fox&#8217;s *Bob&#8217;s Burgers* was doing free portrait sessions on the ship, and once people realized who he was and what he was doing, the line became insane. He stayed late every single session to make sure as many people as possible got their portraits done. I got mine done in the first session, and he still remembered me from previous festivals when I ran into him later. Super nice, super personable, and a genuine superhero for committing that much time to fans.\n\nAWOLNATION was one of the most talked-about acts on the boat. A lot of people had never heard of them or were surprised to see them on a metal cruise lineup, but they won over the crowd. That&#8217;s the beauty of ShipRocked&#8217;s eclectic lineups—you discover bands you wouldn&#8217;t have given a chance otherwise.\n\n### **The Ship, The Vibe, The Logistics**\n\nThis was ShipRocked&#8217;s first time on the [Carnival Horizon](https://www.carnival.com/cruise-ships/carnival-horizon), and there were some growing pains. The layout is different from previous ships, and things felt more spread out. The casino and bar areas—which were the natural congregation points on past cruises—didn&#8217;t have the same centralized energy this year. Instead, people formed smaller groups scattered around the ship. It wasn&#8217;t bad, just different.\n\nFor first-timers (or &#8220;Newbs&#8221; as we call them), the vibe was still incredible. There were just fewer spontaneous crowd moments in the common areas compared to previous years. I also noticed fewer visible artist interactions, but I think that&#8217;s more about the ship&#8217;s layout making it harder to stumble into bands rather than the artists being less present. They were definitely around—you just had to know where to look.\n\nSets started later than I remember from previous years, and there were a few logistical hiccups that felt like new-ship stress. Nothing catastrophic, but noticeable if you&#8217;ve been on ShipRocked before. The Knocked Loose crowd-surfing chaos tested the limits of what the ship could handle, but Shield Security and the crew managed it without incident. Props to them for keeping it safe without killing the energy.\n\nBetween sets? Bring on the food and booze. I ate an unreasonable amount of Guy&#8217;s Burgers, drank way too much Zeus Juice and Splash of the Titans, and hit up the steakhouse for an absurdly cheap price compared to what you&#8217;d pay on land. And then there was the 4am pizza—legitimately some of the best slices I&#8217;ve had, not just &#8220;good for cruise ship food&#8221; but actually good pizza. The food on this cruise was legitimately solid, which is not something you always hear about cruise ships.\n\n### **Why ShipRocked Hits Different**\n\nHere&#8217;s what you won&#8217;t get from [festival recaps](https://metal-mantra.com/category/live/festival-reviews/) or press releases: **ShipRocked is a vacation like no other.** If you love heavy music, this is mecca. You&#8217;re not just attending a festival—you&#8217;re living with the bands, the crew, and thousands of other metalheads for six straight days. There&#8217;s no going home at the end of the night. There&#8217;s no missing a set because you had to leave early. You&#8217;re committed, and so is everyone else on that ship.\n\nThe community aspect is what makes ShipRocked irreplaceable. We&#8217;re family, not just for a week but for life. I keep in contact with hundreds of ShipRocked friends year-round. We meet up at other shows and festivals. We plan trips together. The bonds you form on that ship are real because you&#8217;re all living the same experience together—no outside distractions, no escape routes, just six days of heavy music and shared chaos.\n\nAnd here&#8217;s the thing that separates ShipRocked from every other [festival](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/festivals/): **when the &#8220;rockstar&#8221; finishes their set, they wander over to watch the next band right next to you.** Nowhere else does that happen. At land festivals, the bands are in VIP areas or tour buses or already on the road to the next city. On ShipRocked, they&#8217;re stuck on the boat with you. They&#8217;re at the bars, the pool deck, the karaoke sessions. They&#8217;re fans of the other bands too, and they&#8217;re living the same experience you are.\n\nIf there were disappointments, they were personal and not lineup-specific. Some people wanted heavier bands, some wanted more variety. That&#8217;s always going to happen with any festival. But the lineup delivered on what ShipRocked promises: an eclectic mix of modern metal, metalcore, deathcore, and hard rock with enough variety to keep six days interesting.\n\n### **Final Thoughts**\n\nShipRocked isn&#8217;t cheap, and it&#8217;s not convenient. You&#8217;re committing to six days with no escape route, no early exits, and no plan B if the lineup doesn&#8217;t hit the way you hoped. But here&#8217;s the thing: that all-in commitment is exactly why it works.\n\nEvery land festival I&#8217;ve been to ends the same way—everyone scatters at the end of the weekend, you drive home exhausted, and by Monday it feels like it never happened. ShipRocked doesn&#8217;t let you off that easy. You&#8217;re locked in, and so is everyone else. The bands can&#8217;t leave. The crowd can&#8217;t thin out. You&#8217;re all stuck together, and that forced proximity creates something you can&#8217;t replicate anywhere else.\n\nThis was my first time covering ShipRocked as [Metal Mantra](https://metal-mantra.com/), and it gave me a completely different lens on the experience. Watching Dead Poet Society nail two flawless sets, seeing Knocked Loose turn the Lido Deck into a mosh pit that shouldn&#8217;t have been physically possible, catching The Funeral Portrait at their most genuine—these aren&#8217;t just performances. They&#8217;re proof that when you remove the escape routes and force everyone to be present, the music hits harder.\n\nIf you&#8217;ve been on the fence about booking ShipRocked, here&#8217;s what you need to understand: this isn&#8217;t a festival you can half-ass. You can&#8217;t show up for a day, catch your favorite band, and leave. You&#8217;re either all in or you&#8217;re not there at all. And if you&#8217;re all in? You&#8217;ll understand why people keep coming back year after year.\n\nOne more thing: **don&#8217;t wait.** ShipRocked sells out every single year. The waitlist gets long, and watching cabin availability disappear while you&#8217;re still deciding is brutal. If you know you want to go, book the second cabins drop. Hesitation costs you a spot on the boat.\n\nShipRocked 2027 is already locked in: January 24-30, departing from Miami and hitting Mahogany Bay in Roatan, Honduras, and Cozumel, Mexico. I&#8217;ll be booking the second tickets go live. \n\nSee you on the boat in 2027. 🤘\n\nMore ShipRocked Coverage: [ShipRocked 2027: Jan. 24–30 Cruise Announced After Sold-Out 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/shiprocked-2027-jan-24-30-cruise-announced-after-sold-out-2026/) | [Metal Mantra Sets Sail: Why Shiprocked 2026 Is the Metal Festival Experience You Can’t Replicate on Land](https://metal-mantra.com/metal-mantra-shiprocked-2026-editorial/) | [Shiprocked 2026 Cruise Details &#038; Lineup](https://metal-mantra.com/shiprocked-2026-cruise-details-lineup-2/)\n\nMore Metal Mantra: [Metal Tours](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/) | [Rundowns](https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/)\n\n**More from Metal Mantra:** [Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/)\n",

    "title": "Metal &amp; Hard Rock News – February 3, 2026",
    "content": "\n### Metal & Hard Rock News – February 3, 2026: Grammy Milestones, Major Tour Announcements, and Triumphant Returns\n\nThe heavy music landscape delivered a compelling mix of historic achievements and significant touring news today, with Grammy recognition for hardcore-influenced metal, chart-topping milestones for thrash legends, and multiple major tour announcements that promise to dominate the summer concert calendar. From award show validation to long-awaited comebacks, February 3 brings developments that span the full spectrum of metal and hard rock subgenres, demonstrating the continued vitality and evolution of heavy music across both mainstream and underground channels. Catch more in the [latest Rundown](https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/).\n\n **Turnstile** made Grammy history at the 68th Annual Grammy Awards on February 1, taking home the trophy for Best Metal Performance with their track &#8220;Birds&#8221; in a win that represents a significant moment for hardcore-influenced metal in mainstream award ceremonies and validates the Baltimore band&#8217;s crossover success that has seen them bridge punk, hardcore, and metal audiences while earning critical acclaim and festival headlining slots across multiple continents. The victory demonstrates that the boundaries between heavy music subgenres continue to blur in ways that benefit artists willing to push sonic boundaries beyond traditional categorizations, and the Recording Academy&#8217;s recognition of Turnstile&#8217;s experimental approach signals a potential shift in how mainstream institutions evaluate and celebrate heavy music that incorporates elements from multiple underground traditions rather than adhering strictly to established metal conventions.\n\n **Megadeth** achieved a career-defining milestone by claiming their first-ever No. 1 position on the Billboard 200 chart after releasing 17 studio albums across more than four decades of existence, a testament to both the band&#8217;s enduring relevance and the dedicated fanbase that has supported thrash metal&#8217;s pioneers through lineup changes, industry shifts, and evolving musical landscapes that have seen countless contemporary acts rise and fall. The chart-topping achievement comes as validation for Dave Mustaine and company, who have consistently delivered critically acclaimed albums and maintained a rigorous touring schedule while never quite reaching the commercial peak that has now finally arrived, proving that longevity and artistic integrity can eventually translate into mainstream chart dominance even in an era dominated by streaming metrics and algorithmic playlists that often favor viral moments over sustained artistic excellence.\n\n **Godsmack** unveiled &#8220;The Rise of Rock World Tour,&#8221; a major touring package that pairs the Boston hard rock veterans with Stone Temple Pilots and Dorothy as supporting acts, creating a multi-generational lineup that spans grunge revival, alternative metal, and contemporary blues-infused hard rock in a package clearly designed to maximize audience appeal across demographic segments. The announcement represents a significant touring investment for Godsmack, who continue to draw substantial audiences despite the challenges facing rock radio and the evolution of how fans discover and consume heavy music, while the inclusion of Stone Temple Pilots adds nostalgic appeal for fans who remember the 1990s alternative rock explosion and Dorothy brings a fresh perspective that connects the package to contemporary hard rock audiences who may be discovering these legacy acts for the first time through streaming platforms and festival appearances.\n\n **Omnium Gatherum** vocalist Jukka Pelkonen received a lymphoma diagnosis that will force him to miss the Finnish melodic death metal band&#8217;s upcoming European tour dates, a development that underscores the personal sacrifices and health challenges that touring musicians face while also highlighting the metal community&#8217;s tendency to rally around artists during medical crises with overwhelming support and solidarity. The band has not yet announced whether they will postpone tour dates, recruit a temporary replacement vocalist, or cancel the run entirely, though the melodic death metal scene has historically shown flexibility in accommodating lineup changes when health issues arise, and fans have expressed overwhelming support for Pelkonen&#8217;s recovery and treatment process through social media channels and fan forums that demonstrate the close-knit nature of the European extreme metal community.\n\n **Oranssi Pazuzu** announced their first North American tour in seven years, bringing their psychedelic black metal experimentation back to U.S. and Canadian venues with Wayfarer serving as support in a pairing that promises to deliver atmospheric and challenging performances for audiences seeking music that pushes beyond traditional metal boundaries into cosmic horror and progressive territory. The Finnish experimental collective has built a reputation for mind-bending live performances that translate their studio albums&#8217; otherworldly soundscapes and progressive structures into immersive concert experiences that often leave audiences questioning the conventional definitions of black metal, while their extended absence from North American stages has only intensified anticipation among fans of avant-garde metal who have watched the band&#8217;s profile rise steadily through festival appearances and critical acclaim in European markets where experimental approaches to extreme metal have found particularly receptive audiences.\n\n **Sister Sin** returned from a 12-year recording hiatus with &#8220;Suicide Hill,&#8221; released digitally on February 3, marking the Swedish traditional heavy metal band&#8217;s first new music since their 2014 album and signaling a potential full-scale comeback for a group that built a devoted following through relentless touring and old-school metal craftsmanship that honored the classic sounds of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal while adding contemporary production values and energy. The new single arrives without advance warning or extensive promotional buildup, suggesting either a testing-the-waters approach to gauge fan interest or a confidence that their established fanbase remains engaged despite the lengthy absence, and early reactions on streaming platforms and metal forums indicate strong enthusiasm for hearing vocalist Liv Jagrell&#8217;s powerful voice and the band&#8217;s classic metal approach in a contemporary context that has seen renewed interest in traditional heavy metal sounds and aesthetics among younger listeners discovering the genre&#8217;s foundational elements.\n\n **Spiritbox** performed &#8220;Soft Spine&#8221; during the Grammy Awards pre-show ceremony on February 1, delivering a high-profile performance opportunity even though the Canadian progressive metalcore band did not win the Best Metal Performance category that ultimately went to Turnstile in what many observers considered a competitive field representing diverse approaches to contemporary heavy music. The Grammy appearance represents significant mainstream exposure for Spiritbox, whose blend of djent-influenced heaviness, electronic elements, and Courtney LaPlante&#8217;s dynamic vocal range has made them one of modern metal&#8217;s most discussed acts, and their inclusion in Grammy festivities—regardless of the competitive outcome—demonstrates the Recording Academy&#8217;s expanding recognition of diverse heavy music styles beyond traditional metal categories that have historically dominated the awards&#8217; limited heavy music recognition and often overlooked progressive or experimental approaches to the genre.\n\n **Rob Zombie and Marilyn Manson** announced a reunion tour that will see the shock rock icons co-headline 21 North American dates throughout summer 2026, with Mongolian folk metal sensation The Hu and industrial rock veterans Orgy filling out a package designed to maximize nostalgic appeal while introducing diverse sonic elements that span traditional theatrical metal, international folk influences, and late-1990s industrial aesthetics. The tour marks another collaboration between Zombie and Manson, who have previously joined forces for successful touring packages that capitalize on their shared theatrical approach to heavy music and controversial public personas that made them cultural lightning rods during the height of their mainstream popularity, while the inclusion of The Hu adds an unexpected international dimension that has proven commercially successful for the Mongolian act and Orgy provides a connection to the industrial metal movement that rounds out a lineup clearly designed to appeal to multiple generations of alternative metal fans who remember when these artists dominated MTV rotation and rock radio programming.\n\nTour watch: [Evanescence 2026 World Tour](https://metal-mantra.com/evanescence-2026-world-tour/) | [Metal Tours & Tickets Hub](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/)\n\n**More from Metal Mantra:** [Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/) | [Top 10 Metal Tracks of 2025](https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-metal-tracks-of-2025/)\n",

This is it, folks—the final studio album from one of thrash metal&#8217;s most iconic outfits, closing out a 40-year legacy that helped define the genre. The track carries that signature Megadeth ferocity with a moody, menacing edge that proves Mustaine still has venom in his veins. Released via Mustaine&#8217;s Tradecraft imprint on Frontiers Label Group&#8217;s BLKIIBLK label, *Megadeth* features 10 tracks including a reimagined version of &#8220;Ride the Lightning&#8221;—a full-circle moment as Mustaine pays respect to his early days co-writing with Metallica.

Alongside the tour announcement, the band dropped a brand-new video for &#8220;In Darkness,&#8221; with frontman Will Ramos explaining the track is about growing up feeling distant and embracing that outcast identity many of us metalheads know all too well. Artist presale runs through Thursday using the code &#8220;DARKNESS,&#8221; with general on-sale hitting Friday, January 23rd at 9 AM local time.

    "title": "Metal Mantra Sets Sail: Why Shiprocked 2026 Is the Metal Festival Experience You Can&#8217;t Replicate on Land",
    "content": "\n**We&#8217;re heading back to the open ocean for six days of unfiltered heavy music chaos—and this time, I&#8217;m bringing Metal Mantra with me.** We&#8217;ll keep updates rolling in our [ShipRocked coverage](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/shiprocked/).\n\nIn two days, I&#8217;m flying to Miami. Five days from now, I&#8217;ll be boarding the Carnival Horizon for [Shiprocked 2026](https://www.shiprocked.com). This will be my third Shiprocked (Triple Threat status, for those keeping track), but it&#8217;s my first time covering it as Metal Mantra. The first two times, I was just another metalhead on the ship. This year? I&#8217;m bringing you all with me.\n\n## Why Shiprocked Hits Different\n\nLand-based festivals are incredible, but they&#8217;re temporary. You show up, catch your favorite bands, and everyone scatters. You&#8217;re back to real life by Monday.\n\nShiprocked doesn&#8217;t work like that. When you board the Carnival Horizon on January 22nd, you&#8217;re entering a completely self-contained metal universe for six days. The bands aren&#8217;t jetting off to the next city after their set. They&#8217;re wandering the pool deck, at the bars, standing in line for the buffet wondering why cruise ship bacon always tastes the same.\n\nI&#8217;ve done this twice before, and those moments are what stick with me. I watched Anthrax&#8217;s Joey Belladonna walk past me in board shorts holding an ice cream cone. I saw members of The Struts and Atreyu singing Bohemian Rhapsody and Whitney Houston&#8217;s I Wanna Dance with Somebody (respectively) in the piano bar at 2 AM. These aren&#8217;t curated meet-and-greets—this is just what happens when you put everyone in the same space for six days. The walls between &#8220;band&#8221; and &#8220;fan&#8221; dissolve.\n\n## The 2026 Lineup: Heavier, Broader, Undeniable\n\nThis year&#8217;s [Shiprocked lineup](https://metal-mantra.com/shiprocked-2026-cruise-details-lineup) actually reflects where heavy music is right now. You&#8217;ve got scene veterans like Halestorm and Suicidal Tendencies sharing the bill with modern heavy hitters like Knocked Loose and Motionless In White. There&#8217;s Wage War, AWOLNATION, [Avatar](https://metal-mantra.com/avatar-spring-2026-tour/), Kittie making their triumphant return, Starset (first time back since 2018), and Sleep Theory. It&#8217;s not trying to stick to one lane, and that&#8217;s a good thing.\n\nKnocked Loose on a boat is going to be absolute chaos, and I mean that as a compliment. If you&#8217;ve seen them live on land, you know what kind of energy they bring—*suffocating*, relentless, and completely unhinged. Now imagine that in a room where nobody can leave. It&#8217;s going to be beautiful mayhem.\n\nHalestorm is getting a special performance slot in Nassau. Motionless In White knows how to work a crowd, and seeing them perform multiple times over six days means you get to experience different sides of what they bring.\n\nAnd then there&#8217;s the depth: From Ashes to New, &#8217;68, Dead Poet Society, The Funeral Portrait, and a whole wave of emerging acts that represent where heavy music is headed. If you&#8217;ve been sleeping on any of these bands, Shiprocked is your wake-up call.\n\n## What I&#8217;m Bringing Back\n\nThe first two times I went to Shiprocked, I went as a fan. This year, I&#8217;m going as Metal Mantra—to bring this experience to people who can&#8217;t be there and tell the stories that deserve to be told.\n\n**The performances.** Not just the mainstage sets. Shiprocked has smaller showcases and acoustic performances scattered throughout the week—watching a metal frontman strip back their biggest songs in front of 100 people is something you can&#8217;t replicate anywhere else. This year, I&#8217;m documenting those moments.\n\n**The conversations.** My first two Shiprocked experiences, I had incredible random conversations with band members—casual, unguarded moments you&#8217;d never get in a traditional press setting. Now that I&#8217;m going as Metal Mantra, I&#8217;m turning some of those organic moments into actual interviews. There&#8217;s something about being on a ship with no distractions that changes the quality of conversations. People are more open, more willing to go deep.\n\n**The community.** By day three, you&#8217;re recognizing faces everywhere, sharing tables at dinner, comparing notes on which sets destroyed you the hardest. This year, I&#8217;m documenting it and helping people who couldn&#8217;t be there feel like they&#8217;re part of it too.\n\n**The unexpected moments.** Impromptu jam sessions. Surprise guest appearances. Random chaos that happens when you put thousands of metalheads on a ship with nowhere else to be. I&#8217;ve learned you can&#8217;t plan for those moments—but you can be ready to capture them.\n\n## What to Expect\n\nExpect daily updates while we&#8217;re at sea (when the ship&#8217;s Wi-Fi cooperates). Expect photo galleries, video clips, and real-time reactions. Expect interviews with as many bands as I can corner between sets and pool parties. Expect honest reviews of the performances and the experience.\n\nWhen I get back, you&#8217;re getting the deep dive. The full breakdown of every set, every surprise, every moment that made Shiprocked 2026 worth the trip. I&#8217;m bringing back stories you won&#8217;t find anywhere else, because I&#8217;ll be living it alongside everyone else on that ship.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nShiprocked is where the metal community shows up. Not the gatekeepers, not the elitists—just fans, bands, and industry folks who are all there to celebrate heavy music in its rawest, most communal form.\n\nIn an era where music scenes are splintered across a thousand subgenres and online echo chambers, Shiprocked is a reminder that we&#8217;re all still part of the same thing. The kid who&#8217;s only into deathcore is standing next to the 50-year-old thrash purist, and they&#8217;re both losing their minds to the same breakdown. That unity matters.\n\nAnd on a practical level, Shiprocked is where connections happen. Festival promoters, label reps, band managers, PR contacts—they&#8217;re all on this ship, and they&#8217;re all more accessible than they&#8217;d ever be on land. This year, every connection made feeds back into making Metal Mantra better.\n\n## Final Thoughts\n\nIn two days, I&#8217;m getting on a plane to Miami. Then I&#8217;m boarding the Carnival Horizon with thousands of metalheads and some of the best heavy bands in the world.\n\nThis is my third Shiprocked, but it&#8217;s my first as Metal Mantra. The [first two times](https://metal-mantra.com/shiprocked-2025-review-metal-festival-chaos-at-sea) taught me what this experience is really about. This time, I&#8217;m bringing that knowledge—and all of you—along for the ride.\n\nIf you&#8217;ve been following Metal Mantra since we launched in late November, thank you. This is exactly the kind of coverage I wanted to bring you. If you&#8217;re new here, welcome aboard. You picked a hell of a week to start paying attention.\n\nI&#8217;ll see you on the other side. Stay tuned for updates, and when I get back, we&#8217;re going deep.\n\n🤘 Let&#8217;s do this.\n\n**Follow Metal Mantra&#8217;s Shiprocked 2026 coverage:**\n\nLive updates on Instagram Stories: @metalmantra\nDaily check-ins on Facebook: Metal Mantra\nReal-time reactions on X/Twitter: @metalmantra\nJoin the conversation in our Discord community\n\n*Shiprocked 2026 sets sail January 22-27 aboard the Carnival Horizon from Miami.

    "title": "Metal &amp; Hard Rock News – January 19, 2026: Tours Implode, Legends Get Documented, and Heavy Hitters Reload for War",
    "content": "\nThis was a messy, loud week in metal and hard rock. A long-rumored reunion tour dies in a very unglamorous way. One of metal’s most enduring institutions gets the documentary treatment it deserves. Shock rock icons join forces for a tour that will absolutely sell out. Festival season continues to flex its muscle. And Lamb of God remind everyone why they’re still one of the most dangerous bands on the planet. Catch more in the [latest Rundown](https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/).\n\n## Poison’s 40th Anniversary Reunion Tour Officially Scrapped Amid Financial Fallout\n\nPoison fans hoping for a full-blown 40th anniversary victory lap are officially out of luck—for now. Drummer Rikki Rockett has confirmed that plans for a reunion tour have collapsed due to internal financial disputes, effectively pulling the plug on what was shaping up to be a massive nostalgia-driven run. This wasn’t a scheduling issue or a health concern. This was money. Plain and simple.\n\nPoison are no strangers to fractured timelines and selective appearances, but this one stings because it felt inevitable in the best way. The band’s legacy remains intact, their catalog still moves tickets, and their name alone commands attention. Yet behind the scenes, disagreements over financial structure and expectations reportedly made the tour unworkable. It’s a reminder that longevity doesn’t erase old tensions—it just gives them more history.\n\nFor fans, the disappointment is real. For the industry, it’s another example of how reunion economics can kill even the most bankable ideas. If this situation resolves, it’ll be because someone blinked—not because time healed anything. For now, Poison’s anniversary moment remains stuck in the rehearsal room.\n\n## Judas Priest Documentary *The Ballad of Judas Priest* Set for World Premiere at Berlinale\n\nMetal gods don’t need validation—but Judas Priest getting the full documentary spotlight at the Berlin International Film Festival feels right. *The Ballad of Judas Priest* is set to make its world premiere at Berlinale, bringing decades of defiance, leather, riffs, and survival to one of the world’s most respected film stages.\n\nThis isn’t just a career recap. Priest’s story is metal history—genre-defining albums, lineup changes, near-collapse, rebirth, and a refusal to fade quietly. From *British Steel* to *Painkiller* to their modern-era resurgence, the band has outlived trends, critics, and expectations. Seeing that story framed through a cinematic lens rather than a VH1-style gloss is a win for heavy music.\n\nExpect deep archival footage, uncomfortable honesty, and the kind of perspective only time can provide. Judas Priest didn’t just influence metal—they armored it. This documentary will likely serve as both a celebration and a reckoning, and it’s long overdue.\n\n[Explore Judas Priest vinyl and merch on Amazon](https://amzn.to/4r4XQiI)\n\n## Rob Zombie & Marilyn Manson Announce Massive North American Tour\n\nLove them or hate them, Rob Zombie and Marilyn Manson still know how to command attention—and this summer they’re doing it together. The shock rock heavyweights have announced a sprawling North American tour with The Hu and Orgy in support, creating a lineup that’s equal parts spectacle, aggression, and industrial chaos.\n\nZombie’s live show remains one of the most reliable visual assaults in modern metal touring, while Manson’s return to large-scale stages continues to spark conversation whether people want it or not. Add The Hu’s throat-singing, war-metal energy and Orgy’s late-’90s industrial resurgence, and you’ve got a bill designed to hit multiple generations at once.\n\nThis tour isn’t about subtlety. It’s about volume, imagery, and leaning fully into what these artists do best—provocation and excess. Expect packed sheds, heated debates, and zero attempts to play it safe.\n\n## Rock Fest 2026 Lineup Takes Shape With Gojira, Limp Bizkit, The Offspring, and More\n\nRock Fest Wisconsin continues its evolution into one of the Midwest’s most stacked rock and metal gatherings, and the early 2026 lineup proves they’re not playing conservative. With Gojira, Limp Bizkit, and The Offspring leading the charge, the festival is once again bridging modern metal credibility with mainstream rock firepower.\n\nGojira’s presence alone elevates the bill, bringing precision heaviness and environmental fury to a crowd that knows how to move. Limp Bizkit remain a wild card that still pulls massive numbers, while The Offspring deliver reliable punk-rock catharsis. It’s a lineup built for scale, not niche appeal—and that’s the point.\n\nAs more bands are announced, Rock Fest 2026 is shaping up to be less about genre boundaries and more about sheer impact. This is festival booking with confidence.\n\n[See more festival news at Metal Mantra](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/festivals/)\n\n## Lamb of God Announce New Album *Into Oblivion*, Drop Title Track, and Line Up 2026 World Tour\n\nLamb of God aren’t easing into their next era—they’re kicking the door off the hinges. The band has officially announced their new album *Into Oblivion*, unleashing the ferocious title track alongside news of a massive North American and European tour slated for 2026.\n\nThe new material sounds like a band with nothing left to prove and zero interest in restraint. It’s sharp, violent, and purposeful—classic Lamb of God energy sharpened by decades of road damage and studio discipline. This isn’t a nostalgia play. This is momentum.\n\nTour dates stretch across major markets and key festivals, positioning *Into Oblivion* as one of the most anticipated heavy releases of the year. Lamb of God continue to exist in that rare space where underground credibility and arena-level impact collide—and they’re not slowing down.\n\n[Pre-order Lamb of God on Amazon](https://amzn.to/3LHxUKT) | [More Lamb of God coverage](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/lamb-of-god/)\n\n**More from Metal Mantra:** [Headbangers Boat 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/headbangers-boat-2026-lineup/) | [Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/)\n",

    "content": "\nThe Devil Wears Prada have never been a nostalgia act—but they’re also not afraid to look the past dead in the eye and laugh at it. Today, the band officially unleashed **“Play The Old Shit”**, a previously vinyl-only secret track tucked away at the end of the *Flowers* LP. Fans found it. Fans demanded it. TDWP listened. Tickets and tour roundups live on our [Tours & Tickets hub](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/).\n\nNow it’s live on streaming services, loud and unapologetic. [Listen here](https://tdwp.ffm.to/oldshit), or watch the official visualizer below. No marketing fluff. No mystery left unsolved. Just a blunt, straightforward track that hits different precisely because it wasn’t meant to be front-and-center.\n\nFrontman **Mike Hranica** summed it up best: the band has never really messed with secret songs before, but once the vinyl-only experiment ran its course, it was always coming to digital. Within the context of *Flowers*, the track flips the emotional switch at the very end. It’s not subtle—and that’s the point.\n\nLet’s be clear: *Flowers* isn’t a victory lap album. It’s a band 20 years deep still pushing forward instead of recycling riffs for easy applause. If you’ve followed TDWP from *With Roots Above and Branches Below* through *Color Decay*, this secret track feels like a knowing smirk from a band that’s earned the right to mess with expectations.\n\nIf you somehow still don’t own the record, you can grab *Flowers* here: [Amazon](https://amzn.to/3LIgf5D). Vinyl heads already know why it matters.\n\n## Spring 2026 Tour: No Breaks, No Mercy\n\nAs if the song drop wasn’t enough, TDWP are rolling straight into a full Spring 2026 headline tour. After a 2025 run that took them from Warped Tour Orlando to South Africa, Australia, and across Europe, the band clearly has no interest in slowing down.\n\nThe tour kicks off March 13 in Oklahoma City and runs through April 12 in Nashville, with support from **Four Year Strong**, **Split Chain**, and **I Promised The World**. That’s not a soft lineup. That’s controlled chaos by design.\n\n[Tickets are on sale now](https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fthe-devil-wears-prada-tickets%2Fartist%2F1278537). If you’ve seen TDWP live recently, you already know they’re sharper, heavier, and more locked-in than ever. If you haven’t—fix that.\n\n## The Devil Wears Prada – Spring 2026 Tour Dates\n\n03/13 – Oklahoma City, OK – Diamond Ballroom\n03/14 – Ft. Worth, TX – Tannahill’s Tavern & Music Hall\n03/15 – San Antonio, TX – Vibes Event Center\n03/17 – Tucson, AZ – Rialto Theatre\n03/18 – Las Vegas, NV – House of Blues\n03/20 – Riverside, CA – Riverside Municipal Auditorium\n03/21 – San Diego, CA – Soma\n03/22 – Sacramento, CA – Ace of Spades\n03/24 – Spokane, WA – Knitting Factory\n03/25 – Boise, ID – Knitting Factory\n03/27 – Salt Lake City, UT – The Depot\n03/28 – Denver, CO – Summit\n03/29 – Lawrence, KS – Granada\n03/31 – Minneapolis, MN – The Fillmore\n04/01 – Madison, WI – The Sylvee\n04/02 – Grand Rapids, MI – The Intersection\n04/03 – Cleveland, OH – House of Blues\n04/05 – Raleigh, NC – The Ritz\n04/07 – Jacksonville, FL – FIVE\n04/08 – Fort Lauderdale, FL – Revolution\n04/10 – North Myrtle Beach, SC – House of Blues\n04/11 – Atlanta, GA – The Masquerade\n04/12 – Nashville, TN – Brooklyn Bowl\n\nThe Devil Wears Prada have built their reputation on consistency, and their live show is a big reason why they’ve stayed relevant for two decades. Whether it’s club runs or major festival slots, TDWP don’t phone it in—and this Spring 2026 tour reads like another reminder that they’re still one of metalcore’s most reliable live bands.\n\nBetween a surprise song release, a relentless touring schedule, and an album that refuses to play it safe, The Devil Wears Prada aren’t chasing their legacy—they’re actively trying to outgrow it. Some bands age gracefully. Others stay dangerous. TDWP are clearly choosing the latter.\n\nMore from the band: [official site](https://tdwpband.com) | [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/tdwpband/) | [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/TDWP)\n\n**More Metal Mantra:** [Resistor Announce ‘BITE THIS!’ Album, Share ‘Dead Soul’ Video](https://metal-mantra.com/resistor-bite-this-album-dead-soul-video/) | [Metallica Announce &#8220;Life Burns Faster&#8221; Residency at the Sphere in Las Vegas — 8 Shows, October 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/metallica-sphere-las-vegas-2026/) | [Death Angel Announce Act III 35th Anniversary Tour Leg 2 With Vio-lence + Incite — 35 U.S. Dates](https://metal-mantra.com/death-angel-act-iii-tour-2026/)\n\n**More from Metal Mantra:** [Headbangers Boat 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/headbangers-boat-2026-lineup/)\n",

    "content": "\nThe metal and hard rock world never really sleeps—it just shifts gears. This week proves it again. Legacy bands are celebrating milestones without watering themselves down, extreme metal is loading the van for another brutal lap, and festival season is already throwing elbows for your attention. There’s nostalgia here, sure, but it’s backed by volume, intent, and very real forward momentum. Catch more in the [latest Rundown](https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/).\n\n**Five Finger Death Punch** are officially rolling out their 20th Anniversary tour, and no one should be surprised that they’re treating it like a victory lap rather than a farewell. Two decades in, FFDP remain one of modern metal’s most polarizing and commercially dominant forces, and this tour is built to remind people exactly how many hits they’ve stacked since the early 2000s. Big U.S. stops anchor the run, and the support lineup adds unexpected texture—**Cody Jinks** brings outlaw country grit, while **Eva Under Fire** continue their climb through hard rock’s upper tiers. If you want a refresher on where it all started, [The Way of the Fist](https://amzn.to/3LJ7Ej4) still hits as hard as ever.\n\n**Raven**, meanwhile, are proving yet again that the NWOBHM spirit doesn’t age out—it sharpens. The band announced a spring run with **Slackjaw**, pairing classic British heavy metal roots with modern underground aggression. Raven have always thrived in live settings, and this tour looks aimed squarely at diehards who still value sweat, riffs, and proximity over spectacle. No gimmicks. No apologies. Just volume and history colliding with the present.\n\nSpeaking of collisions, **The Black Dahlia Murder** are back on U.S. roads with a lineup that reads like a deathcore and extreme metal pressure cooker. Joined by **The Acacia Strain**, **Disembodied Tyrant**, and additional rotating support, this tour feels intentionally unhinged. TBDM have spent years earning their reputation as one of the most reliable live acts in extreme metal, and pairing them with bands that thrive on chaos guarantees zero breathing room in the pit. This isn’t nostalgia death metal—it’s a reminder that the genre is still violent, modern, and very much alive. Their recent era deserves a revisit, especially [Nightbringers](https://amzn.to/4pMnJ5v).\n\nFestival season is already heating up too, and **BottleRock Napa Valley 2026** just threw its hat firmly into the rock and metal conversation. The newly revealed daily lineup includes **[Papa Roach](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/papa-roach/)**, **[The Warning](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/the-warning/)**, **Bush**, and **Joan Jett**, all sharing space with headliners like **Foo Fighters** over Memorial Day Weekend. BottleRock has always leaned eclectic, but this year’s roster feels like a calculated reach toward heavier audiences without abandoning mainstream appeal. It’s not a pit-first festival, but it’s undeniably recognizing where rock momentum is coming from. Fans chasing heavier festival energy should also revisit our [Inkcarceration coverage](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/inkcarceration/).\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, **Behemoth** are dragging the underground straight into the fire with the announcement of the **Godless IV North American Tour**. With **Deicide**, **Immolation**, and **Rotting Christ** in tow, this run is stacked with extreme metal lifers who don’t soften edges or chase trends. Behemoth’s recent output has leaned massive and confrontational, and this tour lineup reinforces their role as both torchbearers and gatekeepers. If you need a sonic reminder of their current form, [Opvs Contra Natvram](https://amzn.to/3Ljwq9D) is mandatory listening.\n\n**Black Label Society** are also loading the chamber with fresh album news and a sprawling tour plan that includes a long-awaited EU/UK run. Most notably, the band will hit Scotland for the first time in 11 years, a detail longtime fans won’t overlook. Zakk Wylde’s machine has always thrived on consistency—groove-heavy riffs, biker-metal swagger, and no-frills execution. New material paired with deep catalog cuts is a proven formula, and BLS know exactly who they’re playing for. Revisiting Mafia before the tour isn’t a bad idea.\n\nFinally, the biggest long-game headline of the week: **[Metallica](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/metallica/)** are reportedly in advanced talks for a massive 2027 residency at the Sphere in Las Vegas. If it happens, it would mark one of the most ambitious intersections of heavy metal and high-tech live production ever attempted. Metallica have never been content to tour like everyone else, and the Sphere represents a playground big enough to match their vision. This isn’t about reinvention—it’s about scale, control, and once again forcing the industry to follow their lead. If you want context on how they got here, […And Justice for All](https://amzn.to/4bBHf1e) still tells the story.\n\nDifferent lanes. Different volumes. Same result: metal and hard rock are entering 2026 loud, busy, and unapologetically active.\n",

    "title": "Inkcarceration 2026 Lineup Is a Statement — And It’s Loud as Hell",
    "content": "\nInkcarceration doesn’t quietly announce lineups. It slams them down and dares you to keep up. More metal news: [News hub](https://metal-mantra.com/news/).\n\nAfter pulling more than 90,000 people into the Ohio State Reformatory last year — a literal former prison turned pressure cooker for riffs, sweat, and bad decisions — **Inkcarceration 2026** is back July 17–19 with a lineup that feels deliberately unhinged in the best way possible. Over 65 bands. Three stages. Zero filler.\n\nThis isn’t a festival that hedges its bets. It stacks the deck.\n\n**Friday** kicks the gates open with Disturbed, Papa Roach, Cypress Hill, and Hollywood Undead — a collision of eras that still works because these bands know exactly who they are and why people still show up. **Saturday** pivots hard as Bad Omens officially steps into true headliner territory alongside Gojira, The Used, and Sleeping With Sirens. **Sunday** shuts the lights off with Limp Bizkit, A Day To Remember, Motionless In White, and Ice Nine Kills — loud, theatrical, and completely on-brand for a festival that’s never been subtle.\n\n“*Get busy living, or get busy dying*,” Ice Nine Kills frontman Spencer Charnas said, borrowing directly from *The Shawshank Redemption*. “*We’re thrilled to share our songs of living and dying when INK descends on Inkcarceration.*” If you’ve ever stood in that yard at night while the lights cut through the cell blocks, you already understand why that quote lands.\n\nBut Inkcarceration has never lived or died on its headliners alone. The depth is where it earns its reputation.\n\nMachine Head. Jinjer. Hatebreed. Lorna Shore. Fit For A King. LANDMVRKS. Dying Wish. Sanguisugabogg. Norma Jean. Silent Planet. Born of Osiris. Spite. PeelingFlesh. Miss May I. Hardcore, deathcore, metalcore, industrial, and straight-up pit violence all sharing the same unforgiving space. This is the kind of lineup where stage-hopping is mandatory and conflicts are guaranteed.\n\nSpecial moments are baked into the weekend. Sleeping With Sirens celebrate 15 years of *Let’s Cheers To This*. Rev Theory reunites. Alien Ant Farm marks 25 years of *ANThology*. Ohio acts like Starset, Miss May I, Sanguisugabogg, Wolves At The Gate, and others get home-field advantage — and that energy always hits harder inside these walls.\n\nAnd then there’s the part no schedule can prepare you for.\n\nInkcarceration is chaos between sets. It’s getting tattooed inside a former maximum-security prison. It’s wandering cell blocks that once held real inmates while bass rattles the concrete. It’s dust storms ripping through circle pits, medics moving through crowds, bands stopping mid-set just to stare at the building they’re playing next to. Past years have delivered heat exhaustion, surprise guest appearances, spontaneous tattoos, and stories that sound fake until you meet three other people who were standing right there.\n\nThere’s a reason Danny Wimmer Presents keeps documenting this place. The *Paranormal Prison* series didn’t come out of nowhere — artists, crew, and fans have been swapping stories about strange experiences here for years. Whether you believe in that side of it or not, the atmosphere is undeniable.\n\nDWP founder Danny Wimmer doesn’t downplay what this lineup represents. “*We’re fired up to welcome Limp Bizkit back to Inkcarceration. Their recent South American stadium run sent social media into overdrive. Having Bad Omens headline a DWP festival for the first time brings a whole new level of energy — and adding Disturbed makes this lineup an absolute powerhouse.*”\n\nInkcarceration co-founder Dan Janssen echoed that sentiment. “*After selling out every year since 2021, this summer brings one of our most in-demand lineups to date… combined with upgrades across the site, camping, and parking experience, we’re excited to welcome fans back for what will be the biggest INK yet.*”\n\nTranslation: this isn’t a victory lap — it’s an escalation.\n\nAll pass types — 3-day, single-day, GA, and VIP — are on sale now at [Inkcarceration.com](https://inkcarceration.com/), including layaway options, new student pricing for 2026, and GOVX discounts for military and first responders. Camping, RV packages, and hotel bundles are available, and anyone who’s survived an Ink weekend knows camping is where half the stories are born.\n\nInkcarceration lives in the same ecosystem as [Sonic Temple](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/sonic-temple/), [Welcome To Rockville](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/welcome-to-rockville/), and [Aftershock](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/aftershock-festival/) — but it plays by its own rules. The setting matters. The curation matters. And once you’ve watched a breakdown hit as the sun drops behind prison walls, normal festivals feel a little too clean.\n\nInkcarceration 2026 isn’t just another weekend on the calendar. It’s a test of volume, stamina, and commitment. And judging by its track record, it’s going to sell out — again.\n\n**Tickets:** [Get Inkcarceration tickets on Ticketmaster](https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3DInkcarceration)\n\n**More from Metal Mantra:** [Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/) | [Top 10 Metal Tracks of 2025](https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-metal-tracks-of-2025/) | [Welcome to Rockville 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/welcome-to-rockville-2026/) | [Sonic Temple 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/sonic-temple-2026/) | [Aftershock 2025](https://metal-mantra.com/aftershock-2025-review/)\n",

    "title": "Vicious Rumors Massive 2026 U.S. Tour",
    "content": "\n## Vicious Rumors Announce Massive 2026 U.S. Tour, Drop New “Abusement Park” Video\n\nVicious Rumors aren’t here to play nostalgia bingo. They’re here to remind everyone—loudly—that U.S. power metal still has teeth. The band just unleashed a new video for **“Abusement Park”** and paired it with a sprawling 2026 U.S. tour that reads like a no-frills, bar-to-the-back-wall metal assault. Tickets and tour roundups live on our [Tours & Tickets hub](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/).\n\n“Abusement Park” comes off *[The Devil’s Asylum](/the-devils-asylum-vicious-rumors-review)*, and it hits exactly how you want a modern Vicious Rumors track to hit: sharp riffs, double-kick pressure, and a chorus that doesn’t beg for approval. It’s aggressive without being sloppy, melodic without going soft. That balance is harder to pull off than people admit—and plenty of bands fail at it.\n\n \n\nFounder and guitarist Geoff Thorpe has never pretended this band exists for casual listeners, and that’s exactly why Vicious Rumors still matter. The song’s warped theme-park-from-hell concept fits the band’s long-standing approach—metal as confrontation, not comfort. If you want safe, algorithm-approved background noise, look elsewhere.\n\nThe video itself jumps locations across Germany, Sweden, Florida, and Kentucky, but the real point isn’t geography—it’s momentum. After tour delays caused by Thorpe’s shoulder injury, the band is clearly itching to get back in front of real crowds.

    "content": "\n[Avatar](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/avatar/) don’t rest. They don’t reset. They don’t politely disappear between album cycles. They march forward, eyes wide open, dragging their twisted carnival straight through the woods — and now they’re bringing it back to North America. Tickets and tour roundups live on our [Tours & Tickets hub](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/).\n\nThe Swedish metal lifers have officially announced a Spring 2026 U.S. headline tour in support of *Don’t Go In The Forest*, their latest full-length, which dropped fittingly on Halloween. If you’ve been paying attention, you already know this record didn’t come quietly. It crept in. Then it grabbed you by the throat.\n\n[Purchase *Don’t Go In The Forest* here](https://amzn.to/4sBClHA).\n\nThe band — Johannes Eckerström, Jonas Jarlsby, Tim Öhrström, Henrik Sandelin, and John Alfredsson — already tore through North America once, then immediately doubled down with relentless international dates. This next run isn’t a victory lap. It’s another descent.\n\nThe Spring 2026 tour kicks off April 16 in Sacramento and runs through May 20 in Hampton Beach, New Hampshire, with appearances at festivals [Welcome to Rockville 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/welcome-to-rockville-2026/) and [Sonic Temple 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/sonic-temple-2026/). Fleshgod Apocalypse and Frozen Soul are on support, which means this bill leans heavy, punishing, and unapologetically metal. No filler. No mercy.\n\nEckerström, never one to deliver a normal quote, summed up the band’s return to the States in true Avatar fashion:\n\n“USA. It started off innocently enough. Hiking along on a trail. Sunny. Pleasant. Safe. Then night came, and the trail slowly faded. You can&#8217;t go back, as you don&#8217;t know where you came from. You don&#8217;t even dare to turn around, as you can feel someone, or something, watching… Here. It’s just you and the trees.”\n\nThen he adds, calmly and ominously: “We will be seeing you.”\n\nAvatar aren’t pretending anymore. They know exactly what they are — a fully realized metal institution built on theatrics, riffs, and controlled madness. And live? They’re still one of the most dangerous bands you can see on a stage right now. If you’ve somehow missed them, that’s on you. Fix it.\n\nTickets go on sale Friday, January 16 at 10am local time.

    "title": "Jay Weinberg and Caleb Freihaut Exit Bands as Lineup Shakeups Ripple Through Heavy Music",
    "content": "\nIn the last couple of days the heavy music world has been hit with not one but two lineup departures that carry real emotional weight — not the usual behind-the-scenes reshuffling, but musicians leaving bands where their presence mattered. Jay Weinberg has announced he’s stepping away from **[Suicidal Tendencies](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/suicidal-tendencies/)**, and Caleb Freihaut is out of **The Funeral Portrait**. These aren’t dry press releases — they feel like tectonic shifts in their respective corners of the scene. *More on Metal Mantra:* [News](https://metal-mantra.com/news/)\n\n**Explore Dayseeker catalog:** [Creature In The Black Night](https://www.amazon.com/Creature-Black-Night-Dayseeker/dp/B0FH5QWCZP?tag=metalmantra-20)\n\nLet’s be blunt: losing a member isn’t inherently news unless that member was a defining part of what made a band tick. In Weinberg’s case, he’s been a high-visibility drummer for years across multiple projects. After joining Suicidal Tendencies in 2024 following his decade-plus tenure behind the kit for Slipknot, Jay posted a heartfelt message explaining that the next chapter of his life — including becoming a father and chasing passion projects — means he’s leaving the Cyco legacy behind after nearly two years and countless miles in the van. The split sounds genuinely amicable, but that doesn’t stop it from hitting like a gut-punch for a lot of fans who came to associate him with ST’s touring and recent material.\n\nMeanwhile Calvin “Caleb” Freihaut’s departure from **[The Funeral Portrait](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/the-funeral-portrait/)** carries a very different kind of weight — because this is a band very much on the ascent. TFP have quietly positioned themselves as one of the most talked-about up-and-coming acts heading into 2026, blending theatrical rock, post-hardcore bite, and metal-adjacent intensity in a way that’s been connecting with a rapidly growing audience. Caleb wasn’t just a background contributor; he was part of the chemistry that helped push the band from cult favorite territory into legitimate breakout conversation. When someone exits a band right as momentum is accelerating, it naturally raises eyebrows — not because of drama, but because timing matters.\n\nWhat makes the situation even more surreal is the overlap. Both **The Funeral Portrait** and **Suicidal Tendencies** are slated to appear on [Shiprocked](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/shiprocked/) in just a couple of weeks — a floating festival that thrives on fan access, shared stages, and scene crossover. On paper, that lineup now feels almost ironic. Two bands from wildly different eras, both dealing with key departures right before stepping onto one of the most visible rock-centric platforms of the year. That kind of coincidence doesn’t happen often, and it’s not lost on fans paying attention.\n\nIt’s not just these two. Heavy music has been in something of a lineup shuffle — not mass defections, but meaningful exits. Early last year, Exodus saw longtime frontman Steve “Zetro” Souza part ways with the band, bringing back Rob Dukes in his stead; it wasn’t acrimony on tour, but a classic “marriage over” exit that still had claws in fan discussions.\n\nAnd while it was announced before that Brandon Ellis had left **The Black Dahlia Murder** in early 2025, that shakeup still lingers in the scene’s memory because of how integral he was to that band’s sound for years. Some exits fade fast. Others hang in the air long after the announcement post disappears down the timeline.\n\nDeparture news isn’t always bad news — bands evolve, people grow, priorities shift — but when someone like Weinberg exits a high-profile outfit, or when a key player leaves rising bands like The Funeral Portrait or Dayseeker, it feels like a snapshot of how even the most dedicated musicians wrestle with the tension between touring life, family, side projects, and long-term creative goals.\n\nWeinberg made a point of thanking Suicidal Tendencies and the extended “ST Army” in his farewell, framing this as a step toward becoming a first-time father and pushing his own artistic endeavors. That’s not vague PR speak — it’s a drummer who’s playing the long game and admitting he’s exhausted the well of what he wanted out of that chapter.\n\nCaleb’s departure from The Funeral Portrait doesn’t come wrapped in mystery or coded language — and that honesty matters. In his own words, Caleb explained that “after many years of heavy touring, which have resulted in intense burnout,” he made the decision to step away in order to prioritize his mental health and invest in other parts of his life. That kind of clarity cuts through the usual speculation fast. Still, in a scene that runs on momentum, timing always invites conversation. When members leave just ahead of major tours or release cycles, it naturally feeds into questions about direction, chemistry, and the toll relentless grind culture takes on musicians — even the ones who look like they’re winning from the outside.\n\nThe broader picture? Band member exits are happening, but not in a way that suggests wholesale collapse. This feels like individual stories about people making personal choices — whether it’s reclaiming life outside of punishing tour schedules or stepping away from a project that’s outgrown its earlier mission. For heavy fans, it’s a reminder that the metal and hardcore landscapes are living, breathing things where the only constant is flux.\n\nWe’ll be tracking these stories as they develop — new replacements, side projects, and the ripple effects that come with lineup changes will all shape the heavy music narrative in the months ahead.\n\n**More from Metal Mantra:**\n",

    "title": "Bob Weir, Grateful Dead Co-Founder, Dead at 78 — Not Metal, Still Mandatory Respect",
    "content": "\nIt’s not metal. Let’s get that out of the way. But if you give a damn about musicianship, risk-taking, and the kind of live-wire mindset that heavy music feeds on, **Bob Weir** matters. A lot. More metal news: [News hub](https://metal-mantra.com/news/).\n\nThe **Grateful Dead** co-founder, singer, and rhythm guitarist has died at **78**. According to his family, Weir passed away on **January 10, 2026**, following a long fight with cancer and complications tied to lung issues. He died peacefully, surrounded by family. He leaves behind his wife of 26 years, **Natascha Münter Weir**, and their daughters, **Monet** and **Chloe**.\n\nYou don’t have to own a tie-dye shirt to understand the weight of that loss.\n\n## The Rhythm Guitarist Who Refused to Stay in His Lane\n\nWeir wasn’t a flashy shredder. He didn’t need to be. What he did instead was twist rhythm guitar into something restless and confrontational — fractured chord shapes, off-kilter voicings, parts that moved sideways instead of straight ahead. He didn’t play *under* Jerry Garcia. He played *against* him, around him, and sometimes straight through him. That tension is where the magic lived.\n\nThat approach shaped decades of live improvisational music, whether metal fans want to admit it or not. Long-form jams. Night-to-night setlist changes. Treating the stage like a laboratory instead of a jukebox. Sound familiar?\n\nWeir’s voice and pen are stamped all over Dead staples like **“Truckin’,” “Sugar Magnolia,” “Jack Straw,”** and **“Playing in the Band.”** Songs that mutated onstage, sometimes beyond recognition, and dared audiences to keep up. That wasn’t nostalgia music. That was confrontation.\n\n## A Career Built on Movement, Not Preservation\n\nAfter **Jerry Garcia** died in 1995, Weir didn’t freeze the band in amber. He kept pushing forward through projects like **RatDog**, **Furthur**, and eventually **Dead & Company**. Same songbook. Different fire. He understood something a lot of legacy acts don’t: the past means nothing if it’s not alive.\n\nHe was still touring deep into his seventies, standing onstage night after night, refusing to turn one of the most obsessive fanbases in music into a museum crowd. Dead & Company’s 2023 farewell run pulled nearly a million people. That doesn’t happen by accident. That happens because the music still *worked*.\n\n## Tributes From Across the Scene\n\nTributes poured in fast. **Trey Anastasio** called Weir a close friend and admitted the loss hit hard. **Billy Corgan** kept it simple. **Slash** shared his respect without needing to explain it. That spread tells you everything — Weir’s reach didn’t stop at jam bands or classic rock lifers. Musicians recognized one of their own.\n\nEven outside the music world, Weir was acknowledged as a cultural force — a California original who helped define what American rock music could be when it stopped obeying rules.\n\nBlunt truth: Bob Weir wasn’t metal. But metal’s obsession with live danger, extended performances, and communal devotion owes him a debt whether it wants to admit it or not. You don’t have to love the Grateful Dead to respect the architecture they built.\n\nBob Weir leaves behind a legacy that refuses to sit still — restless, imperfect, and loud in its own way. That’s worth saluting.\n\nMore Metal Mantra: [Rundowns](https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/) | [Metal Tours](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/)\n",

    "content": "\nMayhem are back, and they’re not here to comfort anyone. The Norwegian black metal lifers have dropped a new video for **“Life Is a Corpse You Drag”**, the latest cut from their upcoming album *Liturgy of Death*, due out February 6. If you were hoping for nostalgia, irony, or anything resembling mercy, look elsewhere. This is Mayhem doing what they’ve always done best: staring straight into the void and daring it to blink first. More metal news: [News hub](https://metal-mantra.com/news/).\n\n Stream the track here: [https://mayhemband.lnk.to/LifeIsACorpseYouDrag-Single](https://mayhemband.lnk.to/LifeIsACorpseYouDrag-Single)\n\n*Liturgy of Death* marks the band’s seventh full-length and lands with the weight of four decades of scars, controversy, and survival behind it. Mortality isn’t treated like a poetic metaphor here — it’s a law. An unavoidable one. Mayhem frame death not as an ending, but as the constant pressure shaping every breath before it. It’s bleak, sure, but it’s also brutally honest. And honesty has always been their sharpest weapon.\n\nAttila doesn’t sugarcoat it either. Speaking on the new track, he describes it as “not a slogan, but a ritual and a realization,” reducing consciousness to burden and the body to a temporary vessel already marked for the grave. There’s no self-help nonsense hiding in the margins. The message is simple and cold: if we’ve been dead all along, fear loses its power. That’s not comforting — it’s liberating in the most violent way possible.\n\nThis lineup — Necrobutcher, Hellhammer, Attila, Ghul, and Morten Bergeton Iversen — sounds locked in and vicious. No frills. No polish for the sake of accessibility. Just dark, fast, unrelenting black metal that feels alive because it refuses to pretend otherwise. Forty-one years in, Mayhem still sound dangerous, and that alone puts them miles ahead of bands half their age.\n\nPre-order *Liturgy of Death* here: [](https://amzn.to/49vkcmd) \n\n[](https://amzn.to/49vkcmd)\n\n## Liturgy of Death Track List\n\nEphemeral Eternity (feat.

    "title": "Headbangers Boat 2026: The Complete Guide to Lamb of God&#8217;s Metal Cruise",
    "content": "\n**[Headbangers Boat](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/headbangers-boat/)** is the definitive heavy metal cruise — a floating festival curated and headlined by [Lamb of God](https://metal-mantra.com/lamb-of-god-stubhub-flub/), built by metalheads, for metalheads. The 2026 edition sails from Miami to Great Stirrup Cay, Bahamas aboard the Norwegian Jewel from October 30 through November 3. This guide covers everything you need to know: the full lineup, cabin options, pricing, what&#8217;s included, what to pack, and whether this cruise is worth booking.\n\n## What Is Headbangers Boat?\n\nHeadbangers Boat is a four-night heavy metal cruise organized by Lamb of God and Sixthman, the company behind ShipRocked and other music-at-sea events. It launched in 2023 and has run every year since, establishing itself as one of the most respected niche festivals in extreme music. Every band on the lineup plays multiple sets. Every show is general admission. There&#8217;s no VIP barricade, no genre tourism, no pop crossover filler — just stages, pits, bars, and thousands of metalheads who know exactly why they&#8217;re there.\n\nUnlike land-based festivals where you camp in dirt and pray for shade, Headbangers Boat puts you on a fully equipped cruise ship with restaurants, pools, hot tubs, a casino, and a fitness center. Between sets, the ship stays alive with artist Q&#038;As, DJ sets, podcast recordings, fan meetups, and late-night bar conversations that turn strangers into lifelong allies. The intimacy is the real difference — you eat where the bands eat, drink where they drink, and there&#8217;s nowhere to hide from a good time.\n\n## Headbangers Boat 2026 Dates, Ship and Route\n\n**Dates:** October 30 – November 3, 2026 (4 nights)\n**Ship:** Norwegian Jewel\n**Departure:** Miami, Florida\n**Port of Call:** Great Stirrup Cay, Bahamas (Norwegian&#8217;s private island)\n**Return:** Miami, Florida\n\nThe Halloween timing is deliberate. Costumes take over the ship, stage lights hit harder after dark, and the entire experience leans into controlled chaos. The Norwegian Jewel holds roughly 2,400 passengers and has hosted every Headbangers Boat voyage since the event&#8217;s inception.\n\n## Headbangers Boat 2026 Full Lineup\n\nThe 2026 lineup doesn&#8217;t play it safe. It leans heavy, weird, aggressive, and unapologetically metal. Every act performs multiple sets throughout the voyage.\n\n### Headliners and Anchors\n\n**[Lamb of God](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/lamb-of-god/)** command the ship once again. At this point, Headbangers Boat is as much their domain as any stage they touch. These sets hit harder knowing there&#8217;s no barricade between band and crowd — just deck railings and ocean air.\n\n**Zakk Sabbath** delivers Black Sabbath worship the right way — loud, low, and filthy. Doom riffs hit different surrounded by saltwater and sunburned necks snapping in unison.\n\n### Extreme and Legacy Acts\n\n**The Dillinger Escape Plan** bring controlled chaos to open water, turning mathcore into something borderline dangerous when there&#8217;s nowhere to escape. **In Flames** represent Swedish melodeath royalty, balancing melody and aggression with surgical precision.\n\n**[Death Angel](https://metal-mantra.com/death-angel-act-iii-tour-2026/)** keep thrash alive and feral. **The Haunted** and **D.R.I.** inject old-school violence that still feels relevant decades later.\n\n### Brutality, Sludge and Hardcore\n\n**All Shall Perish** return with deathcore devastation. **200 Stab Wounds** keep things bloody and blunt. **Harm&#8217;s Way** provide hardcore heaviness that hits like concrete. **Kylesa** bring sludge-soaked atmosphere while **Soilent Green** inject grimy Southern extremity.\n\nAdd in **GWAR** for theatrical destruction, **X-Cops** for cult chaos, plus appearances from **Mark Morton Band** and **Chained Saint**, and you&#8217;ve got a lineup that refuses to sit still.\n\n**Full 2026 Lineup:** Lamb of God, Zakk Sabbath, The Dillinger Escape Plan, In Flames, GWAR, The Haunted, Death Angel, All Shall Perish, Kylesa, D.R.I., Harm&#8217;s Way, Soilent Green, 200 Stab Wounds, Chained Saint, X-Cops, Mark Morton Band, and more.\n\n## Cabin Categories and Pricing\n\nAll prices are per person, include $320 in taxes and port fees, and are based on double occupancy. Third and fourth guests pay reduced rates. Solo travelers pay a premium. Cabins historically sell fast — the 2025 voyage hit 90% capacity before the full lineup was even announced.\n\n**Interior (138 sq ft)** — Starting at $1,470/person (2 guests). Queen bed, TV, private bathroom, sitting area. Decks 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11. The budget pick. You won&#8217;t spend much time in the room anyway.\n\n**Oceanview — Porthole (140 sq ft)** — Porthole window, otherwise same as interior. Decks 4, 5. Worth it if waking up to natural light matters to you.\n\n**Oceanview — Picture Window (138 sq ft)** — Full picture window with sea views. Decks 5, 8. A solid mid-tier choice.\n\n**Balcony (200 sq ft + 38 sq ft balcony)** — Floor-to-ceiling glass doors, private balcony. Decks 8, 9, 10. Fresh air between sets and a place to decompress. The sweet spot for most people.\n\n**Club Balcony Suite (272 sq ft + 54 sq ft balcony)** — Starting around $2,420/person. Walk-in shower, sleeper sofa, club amenities. Deck 11.\n\n**Penthouse Romance Suite (334 sq ft + 54 sq ft balcony)** — Aft-facing balcony, butler and concierge service. Decks 8, 9, 10.\n\n**Penthouse Suite (489 sq ft + 144 sq ft balcony)** — Separate living and dining areas, massive balcony. Butler and concierge. Decks 9, 10.\n\n**2-Bedroom Family Penthouse (544 sq ft + 54 sq ft balcony)** — Separate children&#8217;s bedroom, sleeps up to 5. Butler and concierge. Deck 11.\n\n**Owner&#8217;s Suite (791 sq ft + 151 sq ft balcony)** — The top tier. King bed, full living and dining rooms, mini bar, butler service. Deck 10. Haven access not included.\n\n## What&#8217;s Included in Your Cabin Price\n\nYour ticket covers more than just a bed. Here&#8217;s the full breakdown of what&#8217;s included and what costs extra.\n\n**Included:**\n\n4-night round-trip cruise (Miami to Great Stirrup Cay and back)\n\nAll shows and activities — every band plays multiple sets, all general admission\n\nAll meals — gourmet dining rooms, full buffet, casual restaurants open all day and night\n\nBasic beverages — filtered water, non-pressed juices, teas, drip coffee\n\nPool, hot tubs, fitness center, sports court, casino access, video arcade\n\nNorwegian&#8217;s youth program (limited capacity, first-come first-served)\n\nTaxes, port charges, and ticketing ($320/person — already included in cabin price)\n\n**Not included:**\n\nService charges (daily gratuities, varies by cabin type)\n\nAlcohol — packages available for purchase separately\n\nSoft drinks and bottled water (soda packages available)\n\nWi-Fi (internet packages available through Norwegian)\n\nSpecialty restaurant cover charges ($25–$60/person depending on venue)\n\nRoom service ($9.95 convenience fee + 20% service charge)\n\nSpa, gambling, and arcade credits\n\nAirfare, hotels, and ground transportation to Miami\n\nShore excursion purchases at Great Stirrup Cay\n\n## Payment Plans and Discounts\n\nYou don&#8217;t need to drop the full amount upfront. Sixthman offers automatic monthly billing with a $100/person deposit (through March 30, 2026). Remaining payments are split evenly across months leading up to the final payment deadline of July 31, 2026.\n\n**Paid in Full Discount:** Book through March 31, 2026 and pay in full within 72 hours for a 5% discount off stateroom fare.\n\n**Military Discount:** 10% off stateroom fare for active, veteran, or retired military with documentation.\n\n**First Responder Discount:** 5% off for active, retired, or volunteer first responders (EMS, fire, law enforcement, nurses, MDs).\n\n**Youth Discount:** Children ages 6 months to 14 sail for only taxes and fees ($320) when booked as 3rd/4th/5th guests.\n\n**Referral Program:** Earn onboard credit by referring friends. Your referral also gets a discount on their cabin.\n\nAll deposits and payments are non-refundable. Travel protection is available through Travel Insured — the standard policy covers cancellations at 100% for covered reasons, and a Cancel for Any Reason add-on reimburses up to 50%.\n\n## What to Expect Onboard\n\nBetween sets, the Norwegian Jewel stays alive. Expect artist Q&#038;As, DJ sets (including spins from Lamb of God&#8217;s Art Cruz), podcast tapings, fan events, merch tables everywhere, and late-night bar sessions that blur the line between fans and artists. Halloween costumes take things further — because subtlety was never part of the deal.\n\nThe ship has multiple performance venues spread across its decks. Shows run from afternoon through late night. Every band plays at least twice, so you won&#8217;t have to choose between two acts you love — just catch them at different times. All shows are general admission, no reserved seating, no wristband tiers. Show up, find your spot, and hold your ground.\n\nDining is included in your fare. The Garden Cafe buffet (Deck 12) and Great Outdoors grill are free and open throughout the day. The main dining rooms serve sit-down gourmet meals. Specialty restaurants like Cagney&#8217;s Steakhouse ($60 dinner, $17.50 lunch) and Chin Chin Asian ($50) charge a cover. You won&#8217;t go hungry — the question is whether you can eat between sets fast enough to make the next one.\n\n## Great Stirrup Cay — The Shore Day\n\nThe ship stops at Great Stirrup Cay, Norwegian Cruise Line&#8217;s private island in the Bahamas. Guests are tendered from the ship to shore on small boats — a short ride with a solid first look at turquoise water and white sand. On the island, food and drinks from the ship&#8217;s complimentary restaurants are available at no extra charge.\n\nActivities on the island include beach lounging, snorkeling, a zipline course that starts from the island&#8217;s lighthouse, wave runner tours, and kayaking. There&#8217;s also a spa area in the Silver Cove section and private villa rentals for groups who want something more exclusive. Most of the paid excursions are optional — the beach, chairs, and basic food are included.\n\nFor past Headbangers Boat voyages, the island day has included acoustic performances and laid-back sets on the beach. It&#8217;s the one day where the intensity dials back — slightly.\n\n## A Brief History of Headbangers Boat\n\nHeadbangers Boat launched in 2023 — a borderline insane idea that worked. Put extreme metal on a cruise ship, give Lamb of God the keys, and let thousands of metalheads loose for four days. It sold. It delivered. It came back.\n\n**2023:** The inaugural voyage featured Lamb of God, Mastodon, Hatebreed, Testament, GWAR, Shadows Fall, God Forbid, Municipal Waste, Lacuna Coil, Vio-Lence, Gatecreeper, Malevolence, Bleed From Within, and Dying Wish.\n\n**2024:** The lineup expanded with Lamb of God, Dethklok, Chimaira, At the Gates, Soulfly, Exodus, Napalm Death, Carcass, Corrosion of Conformity, Poison the Well, After the Burial, Currents, Bleeding Through, Unearth, EYEHATEGOD, Frozen Soul, and UnityTX.\n\n**2025:** Sailed from Miami to Cozumel, Mexico. Featured Lamb of God, Clutch, Obituary, DevilDriver, Fear Factory, The Black Dahlia Murder, Kublai Khan TX, Power Trip, Crowbar, The Exploited, Eighteen Visions, and more. Hit 90% capacity before the full lineup dropped.\n\nEach year, the cruise has earned credibility by staying focused. No genre tourism. No pop crossover experiments. Just metal, presented the way it should be — loud, sweaty, and unfiltered.\n\n## Headbangers Boat FAQ\n\n### Do I need a passport?\n\nStrongly recommended but not technically required for U.S. citizens. Since the cruise departs and returns to Miami, you can board with a birth certificate plus government-issued photo ID under the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative. A passport card or enhanced driver&#8217;s license also works. That said, Sixthman strongly recommends a passport — it speeds up disembarkation and lets you fly home from a foreign port if something goes sideways. Non-U.S. citizens should check Norwegian&#8217;s travel documentation requirements.\n\n### Can I buy a single-day pass?\n\nNo. Headbangers Boat is a full cruise booking. You&#8217;re on the ship for the entire four-night voyage. There are no single-day tickets, no port-only passes, and no partial bookings.\n\n### Is there an age limit?\n\nChildren as young as 6 months can sail (with a paying adult). Norwegian&#8217;s youth program is available onboard with limited capacity. The minimum drinking age is 21 for all alcohol, though guests 18–20 can purchase beer and wine when the ship is in international waters (3+ miles from U.S. territory) with parent/guardian approval at the front desk.\n\n### Are refunds available?\n\nAll deposits and payments are non-refundable. If you want protection, buy the travel insurance at booking. The standard policy covers cancellations at 100% for covered reasons. The Cancel for Any Reason add-on reimburses up to 50% when cancelled at least 48 hours before sailing.\n\n### Can I bring my own alcohol?\n\nNo. Norwegian prohibits bringing alcohol onboard (wine and champagne excepted). Anything purchased at port is stored by the ship until debarkation. Alcohol packages are available for purchase separately.\n\n### How do I book?\n\nAll bookings go through the official [Headbangers Boat website](https://www.headbangersboat.com/). This is a Sixthman event — cabins are not available through Norwegian directly or through third-party travel agents. Book early. These sell out.\n\n## What to Pack for Headbangers Boat\n\nPack for a cruise, not a festival campground. You&#8217;ll have a real room, real showers, and real air conditioning. That said, some essentials are easy to forget.\n\n**[Earplugs](https://amzn.to/49OB60j)** — Non-negotiable. Multiple indoor stages on a ship means the volume is relentless. Bring quality ones.\n\n**Sunscreen** — Pool deck, island day, and outdoor stages will roast you\n\n**Comfortable shoes** — You&#8217;ll be on your feet for 16+ hours a day\n\n**Halloween costume** — It&#8217;s Halloween at sea. Participate.\n\n**Reusable water bottle** — Filtered water stations are free throughout the ship\n\n**Lanyard for your ship card** — Your room key is also your payment card and ID onboard\n\n**Passport or birth certificate + photo ID** — Don&#8217;t forget the documentation or you&#8217;re not boarding\n\n**Ibuprofen** — For the mornings after\n\n## Is Headbangers Boat Worth It?\n\nIf you love extreme music, community, and controlled chaos — yes, absolutely. The math works out: an interior cabin at $1,470/person covers four nights of lodging, all meals, and unlimited access to 15+ bands playing multiple sets each. Try getting that deal at any land festival once you factor in hotels, food, and parking.\n\nThe real value is what you can&#8217;t put a price on. The intimacy of seeing bands you worship in a setting where there&#8217;s no barrier between them and you. The community of a few thousand people who all chose to be there for the same reason. The complete removal from the outside world for four days — no cell service (unless you pay for Wi-Fi), no traffic, no obligations beyond deciding which set to hit next.\n\nIf you need quiet mornings, early bedtimes, or polite applause, look elsewhere. Headbangers Boat isn&#8217;t a vacation. It&#8217;s a commitment. For the right crowd, it&#8217;s unforgettable. Miss it, and you&#8217;ll hear about it for years.\n\n**Book your cabin at [headbangersboat.com](https://www.headbangersboat.com/) before they sell out.**\n\n**More metal festivals:** [Festival Hub](https://metal-mantra.com/festivals/) | [ShipRocked 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/metal-mantra-shiprocked-2026-editorial/) | [Louder Than Life 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/louder-than-life-2026-lineup-announced-iron-maiden-tool-pantera-mcr-nearly-200-bands/) | [News](https://metal-mantra.com/news/)\n\n**Tickets:** [Search Headbangers Boat on Ticketmaster](https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3DHeadbangers%20Boat)\n",

    "content": "\nThe metal and hard rock world doesn’t slow down—New tours are locking in, festivals are stacking lineups that demand attention, cruise ships are once again being turned into floating pits, and longtime icons are reminding everyone what survival really looks like. At the same time, the scene is forced to confront uncomfortable truths when headlines turn dark. This is one of those weeks where everything hits at once. Catch more in the [latest Rundown](https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/).\n\n## Bush Announce Spring 2026 U.S. Tour With Mammoth and James And The Cold Gun\n\nBush are officially back on the road in a big way. The band announced a Spring 2026 U.S. tour kicking off April 7 in Pittsburgh, pairing them with Mammoth—Wolfgang Van Halen’s ever-growing hard rock juggernaut—and rising UK rock outfit James And The Cold Gun. It’s a lineup that bridges eras without feeling forced, and that matters.\n\nThis tour feels calculated in the right way. Mammoth bring modern relevance and genuine musicianship, while James And The Cold Gun add a raw, hungry energy that keeps the package from feeling too polished. Bush, meanwhile, remain a reminder that [alternative metal](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/alternative-metal/)’s crossover moment still has teeth when delivered with conviction.\n\n## John Bush Revives Anthrax-Era Material at Milwaukee Metal Festival 2026\n\nJohn Bush performing [Anthrax](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/anthrax/)-era material live isn’t just a nostalgia grab—it’s a long-overdue acknowledgment of a divisive but important chapter in the band’s history. Bush is set to deliver songs from his tenure with Anthrax at Milwaukee Metal Festival 2026.\n\nThe Bush-era albums were heavier, darker, and leaned harder into [thrash metal](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/thrash-metal/) and groove than many fans wanted to admit at the time. Years later, those records hit harder than the arguments ever did.\n\n## Headbangers Boat 2026 Finalizes Lineup for Lamb Of God–Led Voyage\n\nHeadbangers Boat has officially locked in its 2026 lineup, led by [Lamb Of God](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/lamb-of-god/) and joined by Death Angel, All Shall Perish, Kylesa, and more. It’s a brutal roster rooted in groove metal and modern extreme sounds.\n\nThis isn’t poolside background noise. Headbangers Boat continues to book bands that actually make sense together, turning the cruise into a floating extension of the pit rather than a novelty vacation.\n\n## Former Fire From The Gods Vocalist AJ Channer Arrest Record Comes to Light\n\nArrest records involving former Fire From The Gods vocalist AJ Channer surfaced this week, detailing charges related to child endangerment. It’s serious, deeply uncomfortable, and not something the scene can shrug off.\n\nWhen stories like this break, accountability matters more than brand loyalty. The metal world prides itself on honesty—especially when that honesty forces hard conversations.\n\n## Rob Halford Celebrates 40 Years Sober: A Milestone Worth Respect\n\nRob Halford of [Judas Priest](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/judas-priest/) marked an incredible milestone this week: 40 years sober. In a genre long tied to excess, this achievement stands as a reminder that survival is its own kind of rebellion.\n\nHalford’s longevity in [heavy metal](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/heavy-metal/) isn’t just about iconic vocals or leather-and-studs imagery—it’s about endurance. Four decades sober is monumental, and it deserves respect from every corner of the metal community.\n\n**More from Metal Mantra:** [Headbangers Boat 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/headbangers-boat-2026-lineup/) | [Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/)\n",

    "content": "\nBlack Veil Brides have officially opened 2026 with a goddamn statement. The band’s new single “Certainty” and its blistering video are out now — and they’re way more than another pretty rock anthem. More reviews: [Review hub](https://metal-mantra.com/review/).\n\n“Certainty” is the first real blood pumping from the veins of the BVB machine this year, and it smacks. Brooding riffs, Andy Biersack tearing through vocals like he’s pissed off at the universe, and a visual that’s as gritty and strange as that teaser with the goat and the hole he was digging. It’s a fresh chapter but it still feels unmistakably [Black Veil Brides](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/black-veil-brides/).\n\nThe song is slated for the band’s upcoming seventh album on Spinefarm later in 2026, and if this is any indication of what’s coming, we’re in for a bruising ride. Andy says the concept of certainty — that stubborn, close-minded prison of thought — is at the core of the record. It’s heavy in both theme and tone, inspired by the film *Conclave*, and it wears that influence on its sleeve without being pretentious about it.\n\nThe official video, shot in Bogotá and directed by George Gallardo Kattah, stitches together eerie performance footage with cinematic storytelling that makes a lot of the cookie-cutter Rock visuals look like amateur hour. It’s cinematic without being overproduced — hell, it’s one of the better BVB visuals in years.\n\n**STREAM “CERTAINTY” »** [https://blackveilbrides.lnk.to/Certainty](https://blackveilbrides.lnk.to/Certainty)\n\nIf you’ve been sniping at BVB for “selling out” or “going soft,” shut up and listen first. Black Veil Brides are no strangers to controversy or reinvention, and with “Certainty,” the band continue to evolve — adding another chapter to their long, divisive history in modern metal. This is neither radio fluff nor another recycled emo-anthem. It’s a band with real chops pushing a dark concept and — no BS — nearly pulling it off.\n\nWhat makes “Certainty” hit harder is that it doesn’t feel like a throwaway single or a label-mandated warm-up. This sounds like a thesis statement. If this track really is the emotional spine of the upcoming album, Black Veil Brides are leaning into darker questions instead of easy answers — and that’s a smart move in a scene that often plays it safe. Whether fans embrace it or argue about it for weeks, that tension is the point. Expect more details on the full album soon. For now, dive in, argue with your friends about it, and try not to get this riff stuck in your head.\n\n**Listen/Buy:** [Find on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Black+Veil+Brides+Drop+%E2%80%9CCertainty%E2%80%9D+and+It+Hits+Harder+Than+You%E2%80%99d+Expect&#038;tag=metalmantra-20)\n\n**More from Metal Mantra:** [Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/)\n",

    "content": "\n## This Week’s Upcoming Metal & Hard Rock Releases — January 9, 2026\n\nThe release calendar doesn’t ease into 2026 — it kicks the door off the hinges. This week brings arena-ready hard rock, symphonic firepower, hardcore brutality, and more than a few curveballs from the underground. Here’s what’s landing and why it matters. More metal news: [News hub](https://metal-mantra.com/news/).\n\n**Alter Bridge — *Alter Bridge* (Napalm Records)**\n\nAlter Bridge double down on their legacy with a self-titled release that feels intentional, heavy, and built for longevity. Myles Kennedy sounds locked in, Tremonti’s riffs hit with confidence, and the band leans into what they do best without chasing trends. This is polished, muscular hard rock done right — the kind of record that lives on turntables, not playlists.  \n\n[Buy Alter Bridge – Alter Bridge on Amazon](https://amzn.to/4jtj1bj)\n\n**Beyond The Black — *Break The Silence* (Nuclear Blast)**\n\nBeyond The Black continue their ascent with an album that blends cinematic symphonic metal with modern hard rock hooks. *Break The Silence* leans emotional without losing weight, pairing orchestral drama with riffs that actually bite. This one’s designed for fans who want melody without sacrificing power.  \n\n[Buy Beyond The Black – Break The Silence on Amazon](https://amzn.to/4aMzANf)\n\n**Bruit — *Monolith* (Re-Release, Pelagic Records)**\n\nThe re-release of *Monolith* gives Bruit’s towering post-metal opus another moment in the spotlight. Dense, atmospheric, and patient, this record thrives on slow builds and crushing payoff. If you missed it the first time, now’s your chance to experience one of the heavier mood pieces of recent years.\n\n**Bullet — *Kickstarter* (Steamhammer)**\n\nBullet keep the engine running hot with a straight-shooting heavy metal record that favors grit over gloss. *Kickstarter* is all momentum — fast riffs, no-frills choruses, and a classic metal backbone that refuses to age out. Simple, loud, effective.\n\n**Iotunn — *Waves Over Copenhell* (Metal Blade Records)**\n\nCaptured live and unleashed without mercy, *Waves Over Copenhell* showcases Iotunn at their most punishing. Blackened doom textures collide with towering atmospheres, making this less a live album and more a ritual recording. Cold, overwhelming, and immersive.\n\n**Läjä Äijälä & Albert Witchfinder — *Circle Of Pain* (Svart Records)**\n\nThis collaboration drags punk venom through a swamp of doom and occult heaviness. *Circle Of Pain* feels confrontational and unpolished by design, leaning into discomfort rather than accessibility. Not for casual listening — and that’s the point.\n\n**Lionheart — *Valley Of Death II* (Arising Empire)**\n\nLionheart don’t reinvent themselves — they sharpen the blade. *Valley Of Death II* is aggressive, direct, and engineered for the pit. Every riff swings like a hammer, every vocal line dares you to stand still. Hardcore with purpose and zero filler.  \n\n[Buy Lionheart – Valley Of Death II on Amazon](https://amzn.to/49tN4v3)\n\n**The Medea Project — *Live At Dingwalls* (Self-Released)**\n\nRaw and unfiltered, *Live At Dingwalls* captures The Medea Project in their natural habitat — loud, chaotic, and emotionally charged. The imperfections work in its favor, making this feel like a document rather than a product.\n\n**Nanowar Of Steel — *The Genghis Khan EP To End All Genghis Khan EPs* (Napalm Records)**\n\nNanowar Of Steel continue walking the fine line between parody and legitimately good metal. The jokes land, the riffs hit harder than expected, and the EP fully commits to its ridiculous premise. It’s dumb on purpose — and executed with skill.\n\n**Push! — *Plowing Ahead* (Frozen Records)**\n\nModern aggression meets forward motion on *Plowing Ahead*. Push! deliver groove-heavy heaviness with a sharp edge, favoring momentum and punch over excess polish. A solid pick for fans of contemporary metal that still sweats.\n\n**Semper Acerbus — *Following Omens* (Eclipse Records)**\n\nBleak, deliberate, and oppressive, *Following Omens* leans fully into doom’s suffocating embrace. This is slow-burn heaviness meant to linger, not entertain. Best consumed in one sitting, at maximum volume.\n\n**Six Going On Seven — *Human Tears* (Spartan Records)**\n\nEmotionally raw and musically abrasive, *Human Tears* balances catharsis and chaos. Screamo in its purest form — frantic, heartfelt, and unconcerned with polish.\n\n**Uuhai — *Human Herds* (Napalm Records)**\n\nUuhai blur folk ritual and black metal ferocity into something primal and unsettling. *Human Herds* thrives on rhythm and atmosphere, pulling the listener into a trance that feels ancient and confrontational.\n\n**Featured Physical Releases This Week**\n\n• [Alter Bridge – *Alter Bridge*](https://amzn.to/4jtj1bj)\n\n• [Beyond The Black – *Break The Silence*](https://amzn.to/4aMzANf)\n\n• [Lionheart – *Valley Of Death II*](https://amzn.to/49tN4v3)\n\nMore Metal Mantra: [Rundowns](https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/) | [Top 10 Metal Tracks of 2025](https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-metal-tracks-of-2025/)\n\n**Listen/Buy:** [Find on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=New+Metal+%26amp%3B+Hard+Rock+Albums+++January+9%2C+2026&#038;tag=metalmantra-20)\n",

    "content": "\nThe metal and hard rock world is doing what it does best right now — colliding eras, genres, and uncomfortable truths all at once. **Metal Mantra** is tracking it all, and today’s [metal news](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/metal-news/) rundown is a reminder that this scene only stays alive when it refuses to behave. Legacy bands are pushing boundaries instead of polishing memories, festivals are doubling down on scale and chaos, and a couple of long-simmering truths finally got said out loud. Catch more in the [latest Rundown](https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/).\n\nGuns N’ Roses kicked the hornet’s nest first, unveiling a completely unhinged list of openers for select dates on their 2026 North American tour. Public Enemy. Ice Cube. The Black Crowes. Pierce The Veil. That lineup isn’t about cohesion — it’s about confrontation. GNR have never thrived by staying comfortable, and this feels like Axl daring the crowd to remember that rock was always supposed to make people uneasy. If this pisses off the gatekeepers, good. They’ve been too comfortable for too long.\n\nAcross the Atlantic, Dublin showed exactly how a city treats its icons. Fans packed the 3Arena for the massive Phil Lynott tribute, turning the night into something closer to a communal reckoning than a standard celebration. Thin Lizzy’s songs still hit because they were written from real places — ambition, loneliness, swagger, doubt — and that honesty doesn’t expire. Seeing an all-star lineup honor Lynott on home soil proved once again that [Thin Lizzy](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/thin-lizzy/) isn’t just part of Irish music history. It’s part of the city’s spine.\n\nReunions can be dangerous territory, but Triumph seem intent on doing this one the right way. Drummer Gil Moore confirmed the band’s 2026 shows will feature full sets from both him and Rik Emmett, with Phil X joining the lineup. No shortcuts. No trimmed-down nostalgia sets. Triumph always prided themselves on musicianship, and this feels like a reminder that they still expect to earn their spot onstage — not be handed it.\n\nMeanwhile, Download Festival continues to act like the gravitational center of heavy music in Europe. The first wave of over 90 bands for Download 2026, led by Limp Bizkit, Guns N’ Roses, and Linkin Park, is pure Donington excess — loud, divisive, and impossible to ignore. Download understands that metal culture isn’t about linear progression or purity tests. It’s about shared moments, emotional release, and sometimes absolute chaos. This lineup checks all those boxes.\n\nNot everything in today’s news is celebratory, though. Faith No More keyboardist Roddy Bottum reflecting on the band’s early ’90s touring with Guns N’ Roses cuts straight through the nostalgia fog. Calling the experience “offensive” isn’t revisionism — it’s honesty. That environment became a catalyst for Bottum reclaiming himself and eventually coming out, a reminder that the road wasn’t always safe just because the crowds were massive. Sometimes success came with damage attached.\n\nJake E. Lee’s latest comments on the never-ending “Bark at the Moon” writing-credit saga land with similar weight. Contracts over creativity. Power over truth. One accidental admission changing decades of narrative. It’s an ugly side of the business that fans don’t like to think about, but it’s baked into the history of heavy music whether anyone wants to admit it or not.\n\nThat’s the thread tying today together. Metal doesn’t survive by pretending the past was perfect or the future will be tidy. It survives by confronting both head-on, amps blazing. Stick with **Metal Mantra**. We’re here for the mess — because that’s where the truth usually lives.\n",

    "content": "\nThe calendar flipped, the hangovers here, and metal wasted no time reminding everyone that the scene never actually sleeps. While the rest of the world was busy pretending January 1 means a clean slate, heavy music came out swinging — unresolved drama, veteran perspective, underground reunions, and a tour announcement that reads like a concussion protocol. This is where things stand right now. Catch more in the [latest Rundown](https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/).\n\n## Nick Pierce Breaks His Silence on As I Lay Dying — and It’s Not Pretty\n\nAfter months of speculation and side-eye from fans, As I Lay Dying drummer Nick Pierce finally said the quiet part out loud. According to Pierce, the band gave Tim Lambesis a legitimate second chance — not a PR stunt, not a half-measure — and he still managed to blow it. No dramatic framing. No sympathy fishing. Just a blunt acknowledgment that the trust extended to Lambesis wasn’t respected.\n\nWhat makes Pierce’s comments hit harder is how grounded they feel. This wasn’t an emotional outburst or a scorched-earth rant. It sounded like someone who’s already processed the disappointment and moved on. As I Lay Dying’s post-prison era was always going to be fragile, and Pierce’s words confirm what many suspected: the collapse wasn’t sudden, and it wasn’t unfair. The band tried to rebuild. The foundation cracked anyway.\n\nMetal forgives a lot. But it doesn’t forget patterns.\n\n## Dave Mustaine Explains Why Megadeth Covered “Ride the Lightning”\n\nSomewhere around the point where time humbles everyone, Dave Mustaine started speaking about Metallica like a historian instead of a rival. In explaining why Megadeth covered “Ride the Lightning,” Mustaine cut through decades of mythology and simply called it what it is: “a hell of a song.” No qualifiers. No backhanded compliments. Just respect.\n\nThe choice makes sense. “Ride the Lightning” isn’t just a Metallica track — it’s a structural beam in thrash metal itself. Mustaine knows that better than anyone. This isn’t Megadeth chasing relevance or playing nice for headlines. It’s a veteran acknowledging a moment that shaped an entire genre, including his own career. If anything, the lack of bitterness says more than any reconciliation narrative ever could.\n\n## Megadeth’s Farewell Still Has Teeth — and an Exit Plan\n\nAlongside the Metallica talk, Mustaine once again addressed Megadeth’s eventual farewell — and made it clear this isn’t going to devolve into a parody of itself. In his words, they’re not about to “Crüe-it-up” with endless goodbye tours and convenient reversals. It was said plainly, and it landed exactly how it was meant to.\n\nWhether fans want to believe it or not, Megadeth’s exit strategy sounds deliberate. There’s no illusion that the band will disappear overnight, but Mustaine seems intent on closing the book with intention instead of dragging the story out for diminishing returns. In a scene where legacy acts often overstay their welcome, that restraint might end up being the most metal move of all.\n\n## Former Mushroomhead Members Reunite as The Ex-Faces\n\nMushroomhead’s long and messy lineage took another turn this week with the announcement that six former members will reunite for two April shows under the name The Ex-Faces. Flint and Columbus will host the performances — which feels intentional, not random. These cities know the history. They lived it.\n\nThis isn’t a reunion tour or a rebrand. It’s a pressure release. Years of lineup fractures, legal nonsense, and creative detours finally boil down to a couple of nights where the music gets to exist without footnotes. For fans who fell off somewhere along Mushroomhead’s endless internal reshuffling, The Ex-Faces might feel less like nostalgia and more like closure.\n\n## Chaos & Carnage 2026 Loads the Weapon\n\nIf subtlety was on your New Year’s resolution list, Chaos & Carnage 2026 is here to ruin it. Thy Art Is Murder will headline the touring extreme-metal pile-on, backed by Carnifex, Bodysnatcher, 200 Stab Wounds, Ingested, and a lineup designed to leave venues structurally compromised.\n\nThis tour has never pretended to be anything other than overwhelming, and 2026 looks no different. Thy Art Is Murder sitting at the top is a logical choice — precise, ruthless, and fully uninterested in accessibility. Chaos & Carnage remains a reminder that heavy music didn’t get softer just because the internet got louder.\n\n**Chaos & Carnage 2026 tickets:** Dates are live and some stops will sell out — [grab tickets here](https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dchaos%2Band%2Bcarnage).\n\nNew year or not, the message is the same: metal isn’t slowing down, and it’s not asking permission.\n\nRelated: [Metal &#038; Hard Rock News – February 25, 2026: Hall of Fame Nods, Ghost Hiatus, and Better Lovers Split](https://metal-mantra.com/metal-hard-rock-news-february-25-2026-hall-of-fame-nods-ghost-hiatus-and-better-lovers-split/) | [Metal &#038; Hard Rock News – February 23, 2026: Tour Turbulence, Fresh Tracks, and Festival Adds](https://metal-mantra.com/metal-hard-rock-news-february-23-2026/)\n\nMore Metal Mantra: [Rundowns](https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/) | [Metal Tours](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/)\n\n**More from Metal Mantra:** [Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/)\n",

    "content": "\nThe year is crawling toward the finish line, but the metal world clearly didn’t get the memo to slow down. Lineup shake-ups, long-simmering comeback whispers, experimental veterans refusing to stay predictable, and yet another reminder that scenes still have reckoning to do — it’s all hitting at once. This isn’t end-of-year filler. This is the sound of bands repositioning, recalibrating, and in some cases, ripping the bandage clean off. Catch more in the [latest Rundown](https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/).\n\n## Veil of Maya part ways with Lukas Magyar during hiatus\n\n[Veil of Maya](https://amzn.to/4q1qv8d) have quietly but firmly closed the book on an era. Vocalist Lukas Magyar has officially exited the band during their current hiatus, confirming that he’s moving on and placing his full creative focus on [Sifyn](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/sifyn/). No public blowup. No messy social media warfare. Just a clean break — and honestly, that might be the most surprising part.\n\nMagyar’s tenure with Veil of Maya marked a massive stylistic pivot for the band, pulling them further into melody-heavy, modern metalcore territory while still clinging to their technical roots. It worked. It also split opinions, depending on how allergic you are to clean vocals. Either way, his voice became inseparable from the band’s identity over the last decade, which makes this departure feel heavier than the low-profile announcement suggests.\n\nThe timing raises eyebrows. A hiatus exit always does. It suggests creative divergence rather than sudden chaos — a slow realization that the road ahead no longer runs parallel. With Sifyn now clearly his priority, Magyar seems ready to build something without the weight of legacy expectations. As for Veil of Maya, they’re once again staring down reinvention. It’s familiar territory for them, but that doesn’t make it any less risky.\n\n## Disturbed start teasing new music, because of course they do\n\nJust when it seemed like 2025 was finally running out of gas, [Disturbed](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/disturbed/) decided to light a match. After a relatively quiet stretch, the band has begun teasing new music, setting the internet into its usual cycle of speculation, hope, dread, and meme generation. Love them or roll your eyes at them, Disturbed still know exactly how to flip the switch.\n\nThis isn’t a band that operates on accident. Every tease is calculated, every breadcrumb dropped with full awareness of the reaction it’ll trigger. Disturbed occupy a strange space in modern metal — too heavy for mainstream rock purists, too accessible for extreme metal diehards, and completely unbothered by either camp’s approval. That stubborn middle ground has kept them commercially massive, even when critical opinion wavers.\n\nThe bigger question isn’t whether new Disturbed material will land, but what version of the band shows up. Another polished, arena-ready sledgehammer? A darker, more aggressive turn? Or something designed to start arguments all over again? Whatever it is, they’re not teasing unless there’s something ready to hit hard. 2025 clearly isn’t done swinging.\n\n## Ulver announce *Neverland*, because staying still has never been the point\n\n[Ulver](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/ulver/) have announced a new album titled *Neverland*, set to arrive digitally on December 31, with physical editions following on February 27, 2026. The first glimpse comes via the track “Weeping Stone,” and in true Ulver fashion, it’s less about immediate gratification and more about atmosphere, unease, and slow-burning intent.\n\nThis is a band that stopped caring about genre boundaries decades ago. From their black metal origins to orchestral soundscapes, electronic experiments, and cinematic gloom, Ulver have treated reinvention as a core philosophy rather than a marketing angle. *Neverland* already feels positioned as another chapter in that refusal to repeat themselves — music for listeners who prefer tension over hooks.\n\nReleasing digitally at the very edge of the year feels intentional, almost defiant. No hype cycle bloat. No festival-season alignment. Just new music dropped into the void, waiting for the right ears to find it. Ulver don’t chase trends. They let time catch up to them instead.\n\n## Bilmuri split with touring guitarist Reese Maslen following abuse allegations\n\n[Bilmuri](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/bilmuri/) have parted ways with touring guitarist Reese Maslen following serious abuse allegations, making the split immediate. The band’s statement was brief and direct, leaving little room for ambiguity. In a scene that’s spent years learning — sometimes the hard way — how to respond to these situations, the move was swift and decisive.\n\nThere’s no spectacle here, and there doesn’t need to be. Abuse allegations don’t require fan debates, conspiracy threads, or performative outrage. They require action. Bilmuri made theirs clear, prioritizing distance and accountability over damage control or silence. That shouldn’t be notable — but history says it still is.\n\nFor fans, it’s another uncomfortable reminder that talent doesn’t exist in a vacuum, and being part of a band doesn’t grant immunity from consequences. The hope is that moments like this slowly shift expectations across the scene. Less tolerance. Less enabling. Less pretending it’s someone else’s problem.\n\n**More from Metal Mantra:** [Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/)\n",

    "title": "Metal &amp; Hard Rock News – December 30, 2025: Scene Drama, Legacy Egos, and Reunions That Probably Should’ve Stayed Dead",
    "content": "\nIf you thought the holidays were going to slow things down in the metal world, think again. The riffs never sleep, and neither does the drama. From legacy thrash beef boiling over in public, to glam-era eccentricity cranked to cartoonish levels, to another classic reunion story ending exactly how you’d expect — here’s the latest from the loud side of the internet. Catch more in the [latest Rundown](https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/).\n\n**Vio-Lence drama spills out in public as Sean Killian calls Phil Demmel “selfish.”** What’s been simmering behind closed doors finally boiled over this week, and honestly, no one should be surprised. Vio-Lence has been stuck in a frustrating limbo for a while now — a band with momentum, goodwill, and a fanbase ready to rage, yet constantly hitting the brakes. Vocalist Sean Killian finally said the quiet part out loud, pointing the finger squarely at guitarist Phil Demmel and accusing him of putting personal priorities ahead of the band.\n\nKillian didn’t mince words. The accusation of “selfishness” cuts deep in a genre built on loyalty and shared sacrifice, especially when fans have already been burned by false starts and half-commitments. Demmel’s post-Machine Head schedule has always been crowded, and while no one begrudges a musician staying busy, there’s a point where side projects turn into roadblocks. This isn’t just internal band politics — it’s another reminder that legacy [thrash bands](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/thrash-metal) live or die on follow-through. You can’t tease the pit and then ghost it. Fans notice. And eventually, they stop waiting.\n\n**Vinnie Vincent doubles down on his $200–$300 CD single price tag.** Yes, you read that right. One song. Hundreds of dollars. And no, Vinnie Vincent is not backing down. The former Kiss guitarist has doubled, tripled, and basically fire-bombed any criticism over the pricing of his new CD single “Ride The Serpent,” insisting that the track is worth more than most full albums released today. In typical Vincent fashion, the logic exists in its own universe.\n\nHere’s the thing: if anyone was going to pull something like this, it was always going to be Vinnie. He’s never played by industry rules, and at this point, he’s not even pretending to acknowledge them. For hardcore collectors, diehards, and those who treat Vincent’s output like sacred artifacts, the price might not be a dealbreaker. For everyone else, it’s pure spectacle — rock star ego turned into a luxury product. Whether this is bold artistic valuation or pure delusion depends on how much nostalgia you’re willing to monetize. Either way, it’s peak Vinnie Vincent, and pretending otherwise would be dishonest.\n\n**Don Dokken reflects on the “disaster” 2016 reunion tour.** If you’ve followed Dokken for more than five minutes, you already know how this story ends. Still, hearing Don Dokken describe the 2016 reunion tour as a “disaster” hits with a mix of honesty and exhaustion. The classic lineup reunion was supposed to be a victory lap — a chance to put old grudges aside and give fans what they’d been asking for since the ’80s. Instead, it became another cautionary tale about unresolved baggage and incompatible personalities.\n\nAccording to Don, the problems weren’t just musical — they were personal, structural, and deeply ingrained. Decades-old resentment doesn’t magically disappear just because ticket sales look good on paper. He’s realistic about it now, admitting that another full reunion feels unlikely, and frankly, that might be the healthiest take anyone involved has had in years. Not every band is built to age gracefully. Some are meant to burn bright, implode, and leave behind records that outlive the drama. Dokken already earned its place in hard rock history. Forcing nostalgia to cooperate rarely ends well.\n\nMetal never runs out of stories — it just changes the volume knob. Whether it’s thrash veterans clashing over commitment, glam icons turning scarcity into currency, or classic bands confronting the limits of reunion culture, the scene keeps reminding us why it’s never boring. Loud, flawed, opinionated, and occasionally ridiculous — just the way we like it.\n",

    "content": "\nThere’s no shortage of noise right now — rumors, wishlists, fake leaks, and “maybe next year” nonsense floating around metal social media. This list isn’t that. What you’re reading below is built on one rule only: **if the tour isn’t confirmed for 2026, it doesn’t belong here**. These are the shows metal fans can actually circle on a calendar, budget for, and lose sleep over. No speculation. No hype farming. Just the real tours that are coming — ranked by how hard they’re going to hit.\n\n \n\n \t\n\n \t**#10 – Ghost – Skeletour 2026**\nGhost’s 2026 North American dates are locked, and the machine keeps running flawlessly. Big rooms. Bigger production. Crowds that know every word. You don’t have to love it, but you can’t pretend it isn’t dominant. [Official site](https://ghost-official.com/) | [Tickets](https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fghost-tickets%2Fartist%2F1878819)\n\n \n\n \t\n\n \t**#9 – Judas Priest – Invincible Shield Tour (Extended)**\nJudas Priest extending into 2026 feels almost defiant. Halford is still screaming, the band is still sharp, and the new material actually hits live. Legacy metal without the embarrassment. [Official site](https://www.judaspriest.com/) | [Tickets](https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fjudas-priest-tickets%2Fartist%2F807246)\n\n \n\n \t\n\n \t**#8 – Pantera – 2026 North American Dates**\nThe arguments are done. These rooms are full, the pits are violent, and the songs still land hard. Pantera’s 2026 dates are confirmed, and the momentum hasn’t dipped.

Massive crowds. Zero filler. Slayer’s confirmed 2026 appearances still feel dangerous, and that’s exactly why they matter more than most full tours. [Official site](https://www.slayer.net/) | [Tickets](https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dslayer)\n\n \n\n \t\n\n \t**#6 – Rockville / Aftershock / Louder Than Life 2026**\nThese festivals aren’t side attractions — they shape the entire North American metal touring year. Lineups drop, routing locks in, and the ripple effect hits every level of the scene. [Festival coverage on Metal Mantra](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/festivals/) | [Festival info](https://dannywimmerpresents.com/)\n\n \n\n \t\n\n \t**#5 – Metallica – M72 World Tour (2026 Dates)**\nMetallica pushing M72 into 2026 keeps the juggernaut moving. No-repeat weekends, rotating support, and a stage that swallows stadiums whole. It’s a victory lap — but it still hits.

It’s urgency. AC/DC’s 2026 stadium dates are confirmed, and every show feels like borrowed time. Riffs, cannons, bells — no filler. [Official site](https://www.acdc.com/) | [Tickets](https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dacdc)\n\n \n\n \t\n\n \t**#3 – Bring Me The Horizon – North American Arena Tour**\nBMTH have fully crossed into arena-level metal dominance. The 2026 run locks it in: massive production, genre-spanning crowds, and a band that refuses to sit still. [BMTH coverage](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/bring-me-the-horizon/) | [Official site](https://www.bmthofficial.com/) | [Tickets](https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fbring-me-the-horizon-tickets%2Fartist%2F1153598)\n\n \n\n \t\n\n \t**#2 – Megadeth – 2026 North American Tour**\nMegadeth this high isn’t nostalgia — it’s reality. The band is tight, aggressive, and locked in. Thrash without safety rails still matters.

Maiden’s 50th anniversary tour is confirmed for 2026, focused on the early years with classics and deep cuts stacked wall to wall. Giant Eddie. No debate.

    "content": "\n## The Top 10 Upcoming Metal, Metalcore, Deathcore & Hardcore Albums of 2026\n\nLet’s be honest — 2026 is already looking like one of *those* years. The kind where release calendars get circled in Sharpie, group chats blow up at midnight drops, and everyone suddenly remembers why heavy music still matters when the world feels sideways. Thrash legends are closing chapters, modern metal giants are doubling down, and the next wave of core bands are stepping up with something to prove. This isn’t hype for hype’s sake. These are records that will actually move the needle. More metal news: [News hub](https://metal-mantra.com/news/).\n\nHere’s Metal Mantra’s locked-in list of the **Top 10 confirmed metal, metalcore, deathcore, and hardcore albums coming in 2026** — the ones worth your time, your money, and your neck pain.\n\n## 1. Megadeth — *Megadeth*\n\nThis is it. The final chapter. Dave Mustaine has made it clear this self-titled album is Megadeth’s last full-length, and everything we’ve heard so far sounds like a band determined to go out swinging. No nostalgia tour cash-in. No soft landing. Just sharp riffs, venom in the vocals, and a very intentional middle finger to time itself. If this really is the end, Megadeth chose violence — and that’s exactly how it should be. ***Jan. 23***\n\n[Pre-order Megadeth on vinyl](https://amzn.to/3LeAmIx) | [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1Yox196W7bzVNZI7RBaPnf) | [Metal Mantra archive](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/megadeth/)\n\n## 2. Anthrax — *TBA*\n\nTen years is a long damn time between albums — and Anthrax know it. Everything surrounding this release screams pent-up energy. They’ve taken their time, tuned out the noise, and supposedly delivered something that justifies the wait. Expect classic New York thrash with modern bite, zero trend-chasing, and that unmistakable Anthrax bounce that still wrecks pits decades later. If you forgot how fun thrash can be, this record is here to remind you.\n\n## 3. Kreator — *Krushers of the World*\n\nKreator don’t miss anymore. Period. *Krushers of the World* continues their late-career hot streak — massive hooks, militant aggression, and Mille Petrozza sounding like he’s permanently wired into a global unrest frequency. This isn’t retro thrash cosplay. This is a band aging like warheads, not wine.*** Jan. 16***\n\n[Order on vinyl](https://amzn.to/4b67We8) | [Nuclear Blast](https://www.nuclearblast.com/)\n\n## 4. Exodus — *TBA*\n\nRob Dukes is back. That alone tells you everything you need to know. Exodus aren’t chasing relevance — they’re reclaiming brutality. Early word points to an album stacked with anthems, pit fuel, and riffs that sound like they were written to break concrete floors. If you miss ugly, violent thrash that smells like beer and bad decisions, this one’s for you. ***March 20***\n\n## 5. Converge — *Love Is Not Enough*\n\nConverge don’t release albums — they release emotional blunt-force trauma. *Love Is Not Enough* reportedly escalates from start to finish, and knowing this band, that means no relief, no clean exits, and no apologies. Hardcore kids will cry. Metalcore kids will pretend they don’t. Everyone loses their voice anyway. ***Feb. 13***\n\n## 6. Gojira — *TBA*\n\nAfter dominating arenas and award stages, Gojira are reportedly steering back toward heavier waters. Fewer pleasantries. Bigger riffs. More pressure. If this really leans closer to their earlier, more punishing sound, expect a record that shuts up anyone who accused them of going soft. Gojira don’t retreat — they recalibrate.\n\n## 7. Motionless In White — *TBA*\n\nTwenty years deep and somehow still growing. This album is being framed as a full-circle moment — old influences, modern polish, and zero interest in shrinking themselves. Motionless In White know exactly who they are, and that confidence bleeds through every breakdown and hook. Expect big choruses, darker edges, and a band fully comfortable being one of modern metal’s standard-bearers.\n\n### 8. Ice Nine Kills — *TBA*\n\nIf this is truly the final chapter of *The Silver Scream* era, Ice Nine Kills are going to make it count. Bigger production. Sharper writing. Still absurdly theatrical. Love them or hate them, nobody in metalcore understands branding, momentum, and spectacle better right now. Expect another album that dominates playlists and festival stages whether purists like it or not.\n\n## 9. Slipknot — *Look Outside Your Window*\n\nThis one’s weird — and that’s the point. Recorded years ago, finally seeing daylight, and intentionally not a traditional Slipknot album, *Look Outside Your Window* is all atmosphere, mood, and experimental tension. No masks required. No expectations met. If you want chaos without blast beats, this might be the most interesting Slipknot-related release in years.\n\n## 10. Ov Sulfur — *Endless*\n\nDeathcore isn’t dead — it’s just getting smarter. Ov Sulfur’s *Endless* blends suffocating heaviness with unsettling melody, and it doesn’t feel forced. It feels intentional. This is the sound of a band refusing to stay boxed in while still hitting like a wrecking ball. Pay attention now, or pretend you liked them later. ***Jan 16***\n\n## Rumored & Anticipated (Keep These on Your Radar)\n\n**Hatebreed** are sitting on something nasty and fast, and if it drops in late 2026, expect zero evolution and zero mercy — just pure hardcore violence.\n\n**Trivium** are quietly circling their next move. If album #11 lands, it’ll likely continue their recent streak of balancing old-school riff worship with modern precision.\n\n**Bullet For My Valentine** are reportedly leaning heavier again. Whether that means *The Poison*-era callbacks or something sharper remains to be seen — but the intent is there.\n\n2026 isn’t about nostalgia. It’s about bands with something left to say — or something left to burn down. Either way, clear space on your shelf and brace your neck. This year is going to hurt.\n\n**Listen/Buy:** [Find on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Top+10+Upcoming+Metal+Albums+of+2026&#038;tag=metalmantra-20)\n",

    "content": "\n**Metal & hard rock news** doesn’t move in a straight line — it lurches, collides, and occasionally implodes. Today’s metal and hard rock news cycle captures that reality perfectly, stacking uncomfortable reckonings, career-defining victories, and full-circle moments that remind everyone why this scene still matters. Catch more in the [latest Rundown](https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/).\n\n**Coalesce** stepping forward with an official statement addressing allegations involving guitarist Jes Steineger is one of those moments that demands attention instead of passive scrolling. This isn’t gossip fodder or headline bait — it’s a legacy band acknowledging real-world consequences inside a culture that too often avoids hard conversations. Coalesce have never been interested in being comfortable, and their response reflects that same confrontational honesty that defined their music.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, **Sleep Token** hitting Gold status in the UK with *[Even In Arcadia](https://amzn.to/4qqoORq)* feels like a seismic shift that’s been building for years. This isn’t industry luck or viral roulette — it’s the result of a band refusing to dilute their identity while quietly pulling listeners from every corner of heavy and alternative music. Love them or loathe them, this milestone confirms Sleep Token aren’t a moment. They’re infrastructure now. Sleep Token’s continued momentum shows no signs of slowing, with the band once again dominating headlines — a trend we’ve been tracking closely in our ongoing [Sleep Token coverage](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/sleep-token/) here at Metal Mantra.\n\nLet’s be real — few bands command a festival stage like **Slipknot**, and the release of [full pro-shot footage](https://youtu.be/g5tXsoj-lx8?si=lIijbb6M-WThQX-o) from their 2025 Resurrection Fest set proves it yet again. Ninety minutes of precision chaos, no filters, no apologies. This isn’t nostalgia tourism. This is a band still operating at full force, reminding everyone why they remain a headliner wherever they land.\n\n**Gojira** continue their slow but unstoppable ascent into global metal consciousness with fiery pro-shot footage of “Ah! Ça Ira! (Mea Culpa)” from Bloodstock 2025. There’s something especially powerful about watching a French metal band channel revolutionary themes on a festival stage built on sweat and volume. It hits harder knowing the wider world has finally caught up to what metal fans have known for years.\n\nThen comes the gut punch of finality. **Refused** officially closing out their farewell run with a hometown performance isn’t just another goodbye — it’s the end of a chapter that reshaped hardcore’s vocabulary. No reunion teases. No legacy padding. Just a hard stop from a band that always understood when to walk away. That kind of exit takes discipline, and it hurts because it’s real.\n\nIf today proves anything, it’s that survival in heavy music is never guaranteed. **VOLA** launching a crowdfunder after losing nearly all their gear in a storage-facility fire is every touring band’s nightmare realized. Entire infrastructure gone overnight. Years of work erased in smoke. This isn’t drama — it’s survival math. Moments like this are where scenes either show up or expose themselves.\n\nMetal & hard rock don’t exist in a vacuum. They live in tension — between accountability and triumph, endurance and collapse. Today’s news cycle isn’t neat or celebratory, but it’s honest. And honesty, even when it’s uncomfortable, is still the backbone of heavy music.\n\n**More from Metal Mantra:** [Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/) | [Top 10 Metal Tracks of 2025](https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-metal-tracks-of-2025/)\n",

    "title": "Lamb of God StubHub Flub",
    "content": "\n## StubHub Apologizes After Lamb of God Tickets Are Mistakenly Listed for Christian Concert\n\n**StubHub apologizes after Lamb of God tickets were mistakenly listed as a Christian concert**, and the internet, predictably, lost its mind. What should have been a routine ticket listing for one of modern metal’s most aggressive and uncompromising bands instead turned into a viral collision between heavy metal culture and contemporary Christian music — a mix-up so surreal it almost reads like satire. For Lamb of God fans and unsuspecting churchgoers alike, this wasn’t just a clerical error; it was a perfect snapshot of how algorithm-driven ticketing systems collapse when metal news collides with mainstream automation. More metal news: [News hub](https://metal-mantra.com/news/).\n\nIf you’ve been paying attention, Lamb of God don’t exactly blur genre lines. The Richmond, Virginia metal titans have spent decades soundtracking mosh pits, festival chaos, and politically charged rage — not Sunday worship services. Yet in Spartanburg, South Carolina, StubHub briefly listed tickets for a Christian concert under Lamb of God’s name, immediately igniting confusion across social media and raising eyebrows among anyone with even a surface-level understanding of metal culture.\n\nLet’s be real — the phrase “Lamb of God” has always carried dual meaning. Long before Randy Blythe ever grabbed a microphone, the term was deeply embedded in Christian theology. But in the heavy metal world, Lamb of God is synonymous with neck-snapping riffs, confrontational lyricism, and pit-level intensity. The fact that a major ticket reseller failed to distinguish between a Grammy-nominated metal band and a faith-based music event didn’t just feel careless — it exposed how disconnected large platforms often are from the scenes they profit from.\n\nThe reaction was immediate and ruthless. Metal fans flooded comment sections with equal parts disbelief and dark humor as screenshots of the listing spread rapidly across platforms like X and Instagram. Jokes about blast beats echoing through church pews mixed with pointed reminders that Lamb of God once sparked protests and controversy — not praise choruses. It wasn’t outrage so much as exhausted amusement, the kind metal fans reserve for yet another moment where the culture is misunderstood by the systems meant to serve it.\n\nStubHub eventually issued a public apology, confirming the listing was incorrect and attributing the mistake to a data error caused by the shared name. Tickets were corrected, refunds were offered where applicable, and the company attempted to close the loop. But by then, the moment had already escaped containment. In the modern metal news cycle, even a brief digital slip becomes a lasting artifact — archived, memed, and dissected long after the correction is made.\n\nAt this point, it’s not exactly shocking. Ticket resellers rely on massive databases, scraped metadata, and automated categorization systems designed for speed and scale — not cultural nuance. Metal bands, especially those with symbolic or religiously loaded names, are frequent casualties of that approach. For Lamb of God, the mix-up feels less like an isolated mistake and more like a symptom of a live music ecosystem that still treats heavy metal as an edge case instead of a core genre.\n\nThis incident also taps into a familiar frustration within the metal community. While pop, country, and mainstream rock are carefully segmented and curated, metal is often flattened into vague classifications or outright misfiled. That disconnect doesn’t just result in awkward headlines — it affects ticket sales, fan trust, and how heavy music is represented to the broader public.\n\nFor fans planning to see Lamb of God live, the takeaway is straightforward: double-check listings and stick to verified sources. Supporting the band directly through officially licensed Lamb of God merch, [physical media](https://amzn.to/3MPT4qo), or confirmed tour announcements via [the band’s official website](https://www.lamb-of-god.com) helps avoid the chaos that third-party resellers sometimes create.\n\nInternally, this episode joins a growing list of strange, uniquely modern metal-world moments that Metal Mantra continues to track — from algorithm-fueled controversies to industry misfires that only seem to happen when heavy music is involved. You can stay locked into the stories that actually matter through our ongoing [metal news coverage](https://metal-mantra.com/category/metal-news/) and scene-focused reporting.\n\nIn the end, no one accidentally walked into a wall of death expecting a worship service — but for a brief moment, the internet was reminded how thin the line is between cultural literacy and automated guesswork. StubHub apologized, the listings were fixed, and metal moved on — but not without adding another absurd footnote to the ever-growing lore of heavy music in the digital age.\n\n**Tickets:** [Get Lamb of God StubHub Flub tickets on Ticketmaster](https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3DLamb%20of%20God%20StubHub%20Flub)\n\n**More from Metal Mantra:** [Headbangers Boat 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/headbangers-boat-2026-lineup/)\n",

    "content": "\n## Sleep Token Face Copyright Backlash Over Alleged Unlicensed Merch Photo Use\n\n**Sleep Token are facing renewed scrutiny after a photographer accused the band of using her live concert photo on official merchandise without permission**, igniting a heated debate over copyright, creator rights, and how modern metal bands handle visual art in an era where merch is as valuable as music. More metal news: [News hub](https://metal-mantra.com/news/).\n\nIf you’ve been paying attention, Sleep Token aren’t just a band — they’re a brand built on imagery, anonymity, and ritualistic presentation. That’s precisely why this situation has struck such a nerve. According to the photographer, a photo she captured during Sleep Token’s 2023 appearance at Denmark’s Copenhell Festival was allegedly reproduced on a limited-edition ritual coin sold at the band’s 2024 Frankfurt show, without her consent, license, or compensation. What should have been a moment of artistic recognition instead turned into a flashpoint about exploitation.\n\nLet’s be real — live music photographers already operate on razor-thin margins. Access is limited, contracts are often vague, and the assumption that exposure is payment still poisons the industry. The accusation here isn’t about fan reposts or social media sharing. It’s about commercial merch — a physical product sold directly to fans for profit — and that distinction matters. When imagery crosses from documentation into monetization, licensing is no longer optional; it’s foundational.\n\nWhat’s made this story explode beyond typical music-industry drama is the context surrounding Sleep Token’s previous copyright behavior. Earlier this year, tattoo artists and fan creators were hit with takedowns after producing Sleep Token–inspired work. At the time, management defended the actions as necessary to protect the band’s intellectual property. Now, with photographers stepping forward alleging unauthorized use of their work, the optics have flipped — and fans are noticing.\n\nAt this point, the controversy isn’t just about whether permission was granted. It’s about communication — or the lack of it. The photographer claims attempts to resolve the issue privately went unanswered, forcing her to take the issue public. In metal culture, silence is often interpreted as guilt, and in a fanbase as hyper-engaged as Sleep Token’s, that silence has only amplified speculation and frustration.\n\nOne of the most thorough breakdowns of the situation comes from **Tank The Tech**, whose in-depth video dissects the photo comparison, the merch item, and the broader implications for bands operating at Sleep Token’s level. The video doesn’t sensationalize the issue — it methodically walks through how visual assets are tracked, reused, and often mismanaged once bands scale into arena-level operations. If you want the clearest visual context for how close the alleged usage appears, this breakdown is essential viewing.\n\nContext matters here. Sleep Token operate behind layers of anonymity, with branding and visuals handled through management teams, labels, and merch partners rather than directly by the band members themselves. That doesn’t absolve responsibility — but it does expose how easily creator rights can get trampled once assets pass through enough hands. This is exactly why licensing agreements exist, and why bands with massive merch operations must treat photographers as collaborators, not disposable resources.\n\nFor fans, this raises uncomfortable questions. Purchasing official Sleep Token merchandise — whether ritual coins, apparel, or tour exclusives — supports the band’s ecosystem. But when that ecosystem is accused of sidelining the very artists who help build the visual mythology fans buy into, loyalty becomes complicated. Transparency isn’t just good ethics; it’s good brand survival.\n\nThis isn’t an isolated issue within metal. As bands rely more heavily on merch revenue than album sales, visual art has become currency. Photos, logos, stage shots, and fan-created imagery now fuel entire product lines. Without strict ethical standards, exploitation becomes inevitable. Metal has always prided itself on community — this moment tests whether that value still holds when money enters the equation.\n\nMetal Mantra will continue tracking this story as it develops. Whether Sleep Token’s camp responds publicly, resolves the dispute privately, or lets the noise fade remains to be seen. But one thing is clear: the metal world is watching closely, and artists behind the lens are paying attention like never before.\n\nFor more deep dives into metal culture, artist rights, and industry accountability, explore our [Metal Mantra news hub](https://metal-mantra.com), check out our [features section](https://metal-mantra.com/category/features), or support the artists you love responsibly by shopping [official merch](https://amzn.to/496O1cy) through verified channels.\n\n**Tickets:** [Get Sleep Token Unlicensed Photo Merch tickets on Ticketmaster](https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3DSleep%20Token%20Unlicensed%20Photo%20Merch)\n\n**More from Metal Mantra:** [Top 10 Metal Tracks of 2025](https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-metal-tracks-of-2025/)\n",

    "content": "\nDeftones, Megadeth, Behemoth, Powerwolf, War On Women, and Lionheart all made decisive moves this week, reinforcing how heavy music continues to evolve, resist, and push forward at every level of the scene. Catch more in the [latest Rundown](https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/).\n\n**Deftones** closing out the year with a new visual statement feels intentional. The band’s freshly released music video for “[Infinite Source](https://youtu.be/oTCw6qtzgOg?si=XGIhuEOKErEeTwwZ)” isn’t flashy or overproduced — it’s atmospheric, controlled, and unmistakably Deftones. The video leans into texture and tension rather than spectacle, reinforcing why the band remains one of the few alternative metal acts still capable of releasing material that feels current without chasing trends. If you’ve been paying attention, this is Deftones doing what they do best: trusting restraint over noise while still hitting hard.\n\n**[Megadeth](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/megadeth)**, on the other hand, aren’t interested in subtlety right now. “Let There Be Shred” arrives loud, unapologetic, and technically aggressive — a clear reminder that Dave Mustaine has zero intention of softening the band’s legacy as they approach what’s being framed as their final album era. At this point, Megadeth’s mission seems less about reinvention and more about reaffirmation. Precision, speed, and venom still drive the engine, and longtime fans will recognize the message immediately.\n\nLet’s be real — the underground never waits for permission. **War On Women** announcing a spring 2026 U.S. tour with **Oceanator** is exactly the kind of forward-motion hardcore needs right now. This isn’t nostalgia touring or safe booking. It’s politically charged, confrontational music being put directly in front of audiences that still want their heavy music to mean something beyond riffs.\n\n**Lionheart** keeping things raw with the “Salt The Earth” visualizer fits the band’s DNA perfectly. No overproduction, no forced storytelling — just blunt-force hardcore energy delivered with clarity. In an era where visuals are often used to distract from weak material, Lionheart flipping that script and letting the song stand front and center feels deliberate.\n\nIt’s not exactly shocking, but **Behemoth’s** Nergal defending the album title *The Shit Ov God* only reinforces why the band remains polarizing by design. This isn’t provocation for clicks — it’s philosophical hostility aimed straight at institutional comfort. Extreme metal has always existed to unsettle, and Behemoth refusing to sanitize their intent reminds everyone why the genre still has teeth.\n\n**Powerwolf** closing the loop on this cycle with the live single and video “Alive or Undead” feels like a victory lap done right. Pulled from the upcoming *Wildlive (Live at Olympiahalle)*, the performance captures Powerwolf exactly as fans expect — theatrical, massive, and dialed to eleven. Live albums only work when bands can actually command a room, and Powerwolf clearly still do.\n\n**More from Metal Mantra:** [Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/) | [Sick New World 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/sick-new-world/)\n",

    "content": "\nScottish Metal Band Faces Naming Clash With Simon Cowell’s New Pop Project More metal news: [News hub](https://metal-mantra.com/news/).\n\n*December Tenth*—the underground Scottish metal outfit that’s earned its reputation one heavy riff at a time—has been thrust into an unexpected legal tangle that’s threatening to drown out its hard‑earned online presence.\n\nThe conflict began when Simon Cowell’s latest pop venture, *December 10*, dropped its debut. The name’s similarity to the band’s own has already begun to skew search engine results, streaming playlists, and social‑media feeds, giving the high‑profile pop act an unintended advantage over the seasoned metalers.\n\nIt’s not a case of genre confusion. Fans can’t mistake a Scottish metal band for a glossy, reality‑TV‑backed pop release. The issue is far more brutal: algorithms prioritize volume and capital over the legacy of an underground act. When two entities share a name, the one with the deepest pockets and the biggest marketing machine will dominate the digital space—leaving the smaller band fighting for every click.\n\nFor a band that has built its following through relentless touring, gritty releases, and a loyal community, a name isn’t just a label—it’s the anchor for flyers, merch, release pages, and every touchpoint that connects them to their audience. When that anchor shifts, everything built around it feels the tug.\n\nThe scene has seen similar clashes before, and the pattern is always the same. Independent artists scramble to correct misdirected streams and search results, while the larger entity drives forward with minimal friction. The imbalance is stark: most small acts lack the legal resources to preemptively secure their brand, and by the time a dispute surfaces, the damage is already done.\n\nDecember Tenth has been a fixture in the metal underground for years, carving out a distinct identity through self‑released material, relentless touring, and unwavering scene loyalty. The sudden emergence of Cowell’s *December 10* threatens to blur that identity across streaming platforms, search engines, and social feeds.\n\nThe metal community has taken notice, and while the pop project hasn’t officially addressed the confusion, the stakes are clear: either the band’s name remains meaningful to its fanbase, or it gets lost in the noise of a pop brand that can afford to dominate.\n\nWhether the dispute resolves quietly or escalates, this episode underscores a painful reality. The music industry, which often touts creativity, can easily bulldoze smaller voices. For underground metal, the battle isn’t just about grabbing attention—it’s about staying visible, staying alive.\n\nMore Metal Mantra: [Rundowns](https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/) | [Metal Tours](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/)\n",

    "title": "Jane’s Addiction Officially Disband Following Internal Conflict and Legal Fallout",
    "content": "\n[Jane’s Addiction](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/janes-addiction/) are officially finished — and this time, it’s not another pause, hiatus, or “we’ll see what happens.” The band has confirmed they are no longer together, bringing a definitive end to one of alternative rock’s most influential, chaotic, and unpredictable careers after months of internal tension and escalating legal issues. More metal news: [News hub](https://metal-mantra.com/news/).\n\nFor a group that spent decades existing in a near-constant state of volatility, this breakup hits differently. There’s no farewell tour being teased. No final album rollout. No vague statements about “time apart.” According to sources close to the situation, the split comes down to a complete breakdown in trust, with legal disputes pushing things past the point of repair — even by Jane’s Addiction standards.\n\nFormed in Los Angeles in the mid-1980s, Jane’s Addiction emerged at a moment when underground rock was fragmenting into new shapes. Led by [Perry Farrell](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/perry-farrell/) alongside guitarist [Dave Navarro](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/dave-navarro/), bassist [Eric Avery](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/eric-avery/), and drummer [Stephen Perkins](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/stephen-perkins/), the band carved out a sound that didn’t sit cleanly in punk, metal, or art rock — and didn’t care to. Albums like *[Nothing’s Shocking](https://amzn.to/4anW0Es)* and *[Ritual de lo Habitual](https://amzn.to/3YxxMjN)* didn’t just define an era; they helped set the table for the alternative explosion of the 1990s.\n\nThat influence is impossible to overstate. Jane’s Addiction were never about polish or predictability. They thrived on friction — musically, personally, and visually. Their confrontational performances, psychedelic textures, and refusal to fit into neat genre boxes made them a blueprint for countless bands that followed, especially those operating in the space between alternative rock and metal.\n\nBut if you’ve followed their history at all, this outcome isn’t exactly shocking.\n\nJane’s Addiction were never built for stability. Their story is littered with breakups, reunions, and half-resurrections, often driven by the same creative tension that made the band compelling in the first place. What makes this split different is the finality. Legal fallout and internal disputes have reportedly made reconciliation impossible, eliminating even the possibility of limited live appearances under the band’s name.\n\nAnd that’s the real line in the sand.\n\nThere are no plans for a goodbye run. No “one last show.” No symbolic closing chapter onstage. In an era where legacy acts are endlessly recycled through reunion tours and anniversary cycles, Jane’s Addiction choosing to stop outright feels almost radical.\n\nTheir cultural footprint extends far beyond albums and tours. Farrell’s creation of [Lollapalooza](https://www.lollapalooza.com) — which began as the band’s original 1991 farewell tour — reshaped the live music landscape, bridging underground scenes with mainstream audiences and permanently changing how alternative music was presented on a global scale. That alone secures Jane’s Addiction a permanent place in music history.\n\nThe band’s dissolution also carries weight beyond nostalgia. Jane’s Addiction existed at the crossroads of genres, influencing alternative rock, industrial, and metal artists alike. Their embrace of chaos, sexuality, and artistic risk helped normalize a kind of creative freedom that feels increasingly rare in a music industry driven by algorithms and safe returns.\n\nFor fans, the news is bittersweet but unsurprising. Jane’s Addiction had been operating on borrowed time for years, and recent developments only accelerated what many already suspected was inevitable. Still, the catalog remains — and continues to find new life through streaming platforms, vinyl reissues, and younger listeners discovering the band for the first time.\n\n[Metal Mantra](https://metal-mantra.com) has long explored how internal conflict can shape a band’s mythology as much as its music. Jane’s Addiction now joins that lineage fully realized — influential, turbulent, and uncompromising to the very end.\n\nIn a landscape obsessed with endless comebacks, walking away instead of diluting the legacy may be the most Jane’s Addiction move possible.\n",

    "title": "Thrash of the Titans USA Tour 2026: Testament, Overkill &#038; Destruction Unite for an Epic Thrash Metal Assault",
    "content": "\nThe thrash metal gods have smiled upon us – **Thrash of the Titans** is back and it’s coming to the United States in spring 2026. Bay Area legends **Testament** are teaming up with New Jersey’s own **Overkill** and German thrash pioneers **Destruction** for a nationwide tour that promises to bring total metallic chaos to every city it hits. This tour is more than just a concert series; it’s a celebration of the energy and legacy of thrash metal, uniting three veteran bands whose combined influence spans nearly four decades. Tickets and tour roundups live on our [Tours & Tickets hub](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/).\n\nEven the official tour poster screams pure ’80s thrash attitude, featuring a sinister skull-faced mascot and bold, electrifying artwork. Dubbed the *“Thrash of the Titans”* U.S. Tour, this run will tear through major markets from the West Coast to the East. Fans can expect an all-out assault of whiplash-inducing riffs, breakneck drums, and mosh pits that feel like time-travel back to the genre’s golden era. Each band on the bill is a bona fide titan: Testament just dropped their crushing new album [*Para Bellum*](https://amzn.to/3YwIwPn) in October to roaring acclaim, Overkill continue to uphold East Coast thrash with unapologetic ferocity, and Destruction fly the flag for Teutonic thrash as fiercely as ever. In short, this tour is a dream come true for thrash metal fans hungry for a no-holds-barred live experience.\n\n## Thrash Metal Legends Unite – An Unmissable Event\n\nWhen it comes to thrash pedigree, this lineup is second to none. Between them, Testament, Overkill, and Destruction have nearly 40 years of friendship and shared history on the frontlines of metal. Testament helped define the late-’80s Bay Area thrash sound and remain “one of the greatest thrash metal acts of all time”, while Overkill’s status as perpetual road warriors (with a whopping 20 studio albums to their name) earns them the title of thrash’s East Coast ironmen. Not to be outdone, Destruction are among the earliest German thrash outfits, inspiring countless others since the early ’80s. It’s no wonder Testament frontman Chuck Billy is stoked for this tour’s incendiary potential. In his words:\n\n“2026 looks like it is going to start with an explosion with the ‘Thrash of the Titans’ Tour. Joining us will be our Metal Brothers Overkill and Destruction. Our friendship has almost reached 4 decades. This is gonna be a Thrash Metal show you don’t wanna miss!”\n\n– Chuck Billy, Testament vocalist\n\nTestament’s ferocious live performances and powerhouse vocals have only grown more intense with time (Loudwire even honored *Para Bellum* as the best metal album of 2025). Overkill’s Bobby “Blitz” Ellsworth, never one to hold back, adds that “March can’t come soon enough” for this “killer package that will lay waste to the States” – a sentiment every die-hard thrasher can agree with. Destruction, led by the indomitable Schmier, are fresh off a successful European leg of *Thrash of the Titans* and are poised to deliver their razor-sharp riffs and high-octane stage show to U.S. audiences. In other words, expect headbangers’ heaven. The energy in the venues each night will be off the charts as these three veteran acts ignite the stage with classic anthems and new thrash artillery alike. (Pro tip: start warming up those neck muscles now for all the headbanging in your near future!)\n\n## Exclusive Presales & Ticket On-Sale Info\n\nFor those ready to secure their spot in the pit, several ticket presales will give the most devoted fans first crack at tickets.

    "title": "Rock for People 2026 Names Halsey as Final Headliner for Festival: Locks in Top 10 Status in Europe",
    "content": "\n**[Rock for People 2026](/tag/rock-for-people/)** has officially named its final headliner for next summer, and it’s not playing it safe. Halsey will headline the Czech festival for the first time ever, locking in her debut performance in the country and completing the top line of what’s shaping up to be one of the most aggressive, genre-defying European festival lineups of the year. We&#8217;ll keep updates rolling in our [Rock for People 2026 coverage](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/rock-for-people-2026/).\n\n**Tickets:** [Buy Rock for People 2026 passes now](https://rockforpeople.cz/en/tickets/) (VIP/COMFY+ are moving fast).\n\nThe announcement arrived December 15 via the festival’s annual Advent calendar reveal, confirming Halsey’s headline set for **June 13, 2026** at Park 360 in Hradec Králové. She joins a heavyweight Rock for People 2026 bill already stacked with Gorillaz, Limp Bizkit, [Bring Me The Horizon](/tag/bring-me-the-horizon/), and Iron Maiden — a lineup that doesn’t just span generations, but actively challenges expectations.\n\nLet’s be clear: this isn’t a “safe” booking. And that’s the point.\n\nHalsey doesn’t play by genre rules, and never has. She’s headlined Reading & Leeds. She’s dominated Sziget. She’s collaborated with Bring Me The Horizon on a full-blown metalcore track and traded pop-punk chaos with Machine Gun Kelly on “forget me too.” If you still think she’s just a pop act, you haven’t been paying attention — or you’re choosing not to.\n\nFestival founder Michal Thomes called it exactly what it is: closing the headliner announcements with a modern, world-class artist who actually makes sense in 2026. Love her or hate her, Halsey commands crowds, headlines massive festivals, and brings a fanbase that shows up loud. That matters.\n\nHer timing couldn’t be better either. This year marks **10 years of “Badlands”** — an album that refuses to die and keeps going viral for all the right reasons. “Colors.” “Gasoline.” “Control.” Still hitting. Still resonating. Over **5.8 million albums sold**, **7.5 billion streams**, and every single track eligible for RIAA certification — something that’s only happened twice before in history.\n\nThat’s not hype. That’s impact.\n\nFast forward to now and Halsey sits on over **50 billion global streams**, four RIAA-certified albums, and the rare distinction of having **four separate songs hit one billion streams on Spotify**. Her most recent release, *The Great Impersonator* (October 2024), leaned hard into identity, reinvention, and darker emotional textures — a move that lands far closer to alternative culture than mainstream fluff.\n\nMeanwhile, Rock for People keeps leveling up. The festival has officially been named among the **TOP 10 best festivals in Europe** at the European Festival Awards, earning nominations for Best Major Festival, Promoter of the Year, and Event Safety. That’s not marketing spin — that’s international recognition, alongside heavyweights like Hellfest, Primavera Sound, Rock Werchter, Roskilde, Tomorrowland, and Sziget.\n\nTickets are already moving fast. Organizers confirmed that **VIP and COMFY+ passes are close to selling out**, with overall demand tracking higher than last year’s record-breaking edition. If you’re on the fence, that’s on you. Tickets are available here: [Rock for People 2026 tickets](https://rockforpeople.cz/en/tickets/)\n\nThe Advent calendar rollout isn’t done yet either. Fifteen of twenty-four new names have been revealed so far, including Wolf Alice, A Day To Remember, Trivium, Queensrÿche, letlive., Within Temptation, Badflower, and more. Nine more bands are still coming, and if the pacing tells us anything, the curveballs aren’t finished.\n\nRock for People 2026 is shaping up to be a genre-collision in the best way possible — metal, hardcore, alternative, pop-adjacent chaos, and legacy acts all sharing the same battlefield. Some purists will complain. They always do. Everyone else will be too busy watching one of Europe’s best festivals continue to outgrow expectations.\n\nIf this feels familiar, it should. Two years ago, Rock for People caught heat for booking Yungblud — plenty of noise, plenty of doubt. Then he walked onstage, leveled the place, and walked off as one of the weekend’s biggest wins. Booking Halsey next to [Iron Maiden](/tag/iron-maiden/) and BMTH isn’t a gamble. It’s pattern recognition.\n\n## Why Iron Maiden’s Presence Changes the Entire Lineup\n\nIron Maiden sitting atop the Rock for People 2026 lineup isn’t just another legacy booking — it fundamentally reshapes how the entire bill is perceived. When a band with this level of history headlines, everything around them gets reframed. New artists feel riskier. Genre lines blur faster. Expectations rise across the board.\n\nThat’s the weight of **Iron Maiden’s legacy**. Decades of albums, tours, and cultural influence have made them more than just festival headliners — they’re a measuring stick. Sharing a bill with Maiden isn’t about nostalgia; it’s about standing next to one of the most complete and influential discographies heavy music has ever produced.\n\nFor fans who want deeper context on why Iron Maiden can anchor a lineup this diverse in 2026, our full breakdown of [**Iron Maiden’s discography and legacy**](/iron-maiden-discography-legacy/) explores how the band’s catalog evolved, why it still commands global festival stages, and how it continues to influence the modern acts standing beside them.\n\nSometimes evolution is loud. Sometimes it’s uncomfortable. And sometimes it sells out anyway.\n\n**Rock for People 2026 takes place June 10–14 at Park 360, Hradec Králové.**\n\n**Buy Rock for People 2026 passes now** before this tier closes: [rockforpeople.cz/en/tickets](https://rockforpeople.cz/en/tickets/)\n\nRelated: [Rock for People Adds Knocked Loose, Saxon, Alexisonfire to Iron Maiden Day](https://metal-mantra.com/rock-for-people-2026-iron-maiden-knocked-loose/) | [Gorillaz &#038; Limp Bizkit Announced for Rock for People 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/gorillaz-limp-bizkit-announced-for-rock-for-people-2026/)\n\nMore Metal Mantra: [Metal Tours & Tickets Hub](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/) | [Rundowns](https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/)\n\n**Tickets:** [Get Rock for People tickets on Ticketmaster](https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3DRock%20for%20People)\n\n**More from Metal Mantra:** [Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/) | [Iron Maiden Discography &#038; Legacy](https://metal-mantra.com/iron-maiden-discography-legacy/) | [Aftershock 2025](https://metal-mantra.com/aftershock-2025-review/)\n",

    "title": "Evanescence Bring Jacoby Shaddix Onstage for “Bring Me to Life” at KROQ Almost Acoustic Christmas",
    "content": "\nEvanescence Bring Me to Life live became one of the most talked-about moments at KROQ Almost Acoustic Christmas when the band brought Papa Roach’s Jacoby Shaddix onstage for a surprise performance of “Bring Me to Life” during their set. The unexpected collaboration instantly electrified the venue and sent waves through the metal and hard rock community, reigniting excitement around one of the most defining crossover songs of the early 2000s. More metal news: [News hub](https://metal-mantra.com/news/).\n\nOriginally released in 2003 as part of Evanescence’s breakthrough album *Fallen*, “Bring Me to Life” helped introduce a generation of listeners to a darker, more emotional form of mainstream heavy music. While the studio version famously featured male guest vocals, live performances of the song have evolved significantly over the years. Evanescence has often reshaped the track to reflect the band’s growth, making guest appearances rare and deliberate. Bringing Jacoby Shaddix into the performance felt less like a nostalgic callback and more like a deliberate reimagining that honored the song’s legacy while injecting it with renewed intensity.\n\nThe chemistry between **Amy Lee** and Shaddix was immediate. Lee’s controlled, soaring vocal delivery contrasted sharply with Shaddix’s aggressive, rhythmic approach, creating a push-and-pull dynamic that reminded audiences why “Bring Me to Life” resonated so deeply when it first arrived. The crowd’s reaction was instantaneous, with the entire venue erupting as Shaddix took over the song’s iconic verses and trade-offs with Lee.\n\nThis moment also highlighted Evanescence’s continued relevance within modern heavy music. Rather than relying solely on legacy status, the band continues to reinterpret its catalog in ways that feel current and authentic. As previously covered on [Metal Mantra](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/evanescence/), Evanescence has consistently found ways to balance reverence for their past with a forward-looking approach that keeps their live performances compelling.\n\nFor Jacoby Shaddix, the guest appearance reinforced his ongoing presence within the metal and hard rock scene. Papa Roach remains a dominant live force, and Shaddix’s adaptability as a vocalist allows him to move seamlessly between melody and raw aggression. His contribution to “Bring Me to Life” felt natural rather than forced, underscoring the shared musical lineage between the two bands that emerged during the same era of heavy alternative music.\n\nKROQ Almost Acoustic Christmas has long been known for producing memorable collaborative moments, and this performance fit squarely within that tradition. The festival’s blend of alternative rock, hard rock, and metal creates an environment where surprises feel organic rather than scripted. Evanescence’s decision to bring Shaddix onstage elevated their set beyond a standard festival appearance, turning it into a defining moment of the event.\n\nAs fan-filmed clips of the performance continue circulating online, reactions have centered on the emotional impact and chemistry between Lee and Shaddix. For many fans, the collaboration bridged eras, reconnecting listeners with the music that first drew them into heavy rock while presenting it in a modern, revitalized form.\n\nFor listeners revisiting Evanescence’s catalog, *Fallen* remains essential listening. The album continues to be widely available through platforms like [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00019GG1M?&linkCode=ll1&tag=metalmantra-20&linkId=9c7534e4e29f95f5fe025936235391f9&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl), where both physical and digital editions remain popular with longtime fans and new listeners alike.\n\nIn an era dominated by rapid-release cycles and algorithm-driven discovery, moments like this stand out because they can’t be manufactured. Evanescence and Jacoby Shaddix didn’t just perform a song — they reaffirmed its place in the ongoing story of modern metal and hard rock, reminding fans why live music remains one of the most powerful experiences the genre has to offer.\n",

    "content": "\nIron Maiden’s 2026 tour continues to grow as the legendary band expands their *Run For Your Lives* World Tour with a massive new leg of dates. What began as a celebratory victory lap has evolved into one of the most ambitious and far-reaching touring cycles of Iron Maiden’s career, blending festival headline slots, stadium performances, and major arena shows across multiple continents. Tickets and tour roundups live on our [Tours & Tickets hub](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/).\n\nThe continued expansion of the *Run For Your Lives world tour* reinforces Iron Maiden’s status as one of the most dominant live metal acts in the world, even five decades into their career. Rather than limiting the anniversary celebration to a single year, the band has structured this tour as a rolling global event, responding directly to sustained demand from fans worldwide.\n\n## A 50-Year Legacy Meets a Global Touring Juggernaut\n\nFirst announced in September 2024, the *Iron Maiden anniversary tour* was designed to celebrate the band’s formation in 1975 while highlighting the legacy-defining era of their catalog. Instead of following a traditional album-cycle format, the band opted for a long-term touring strategy that allows new dates to be added as markets open and demand continues to surge.\n\nThe tour officially launched in May 2025 in Budapest, Hungary, quickly selling out stadiums and festival appearances across Europe. With the newly announced 2026 expansion, Iron Maiden will continue touring deep into the fall, with the current schedule projected to conclude in October 2026 — marking nearly two full years of global heavy metal domination.\n\n## Iron Maiden 2026 Tour Dates — Europe, North America & Beyond\n\nBelow are the currently confirmed **Iron Maiden tour dates for 2026** as part of the *Run For Your Lives* world tour.

The approach emphasizes legacy-defining tracks while reintroducing deep cuts that longtime fans may not have heard live in decades.\n\n For collectors and longtime fans, essential Iron Maiden albums on [vinyl and CD](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=iron+maiden+vinyl&linkCode=ll1&tag=metalmantra-20&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) remain widely available.\n\nThis balance between accessibility and deep-catalog respect has become a defining feature of Iron Maiden’s modern touring era. For a deeper look at how this tour fits into their career arc, explore our [Iron Maiden discography & legacy ranking](/metal-mantra/iron-maiden-discography-legacy-ranking).\n\n## Iron Maiden’s Legacy Still Shapes Modern Metal\n\nWhat makes the *Run For Your Lives* tour hit harder than a standard anniversary run is how directly it taps into **Iron Maiden’s legacy** — not as a nostalgia act, but as a living blueprint for heavy metal. From the twin-guitar attack to the theatrical stage production and marathon setlists, this tour pulls from decades of influence that still echo through modern metal and hard rock.\n\nThe setlist choices alone underline how deep the band’s catalog runs. Tracks pulled from Maiden’s classic era don’t just exist as crowd-pleasers — they represent the foundation of an **Iron Maiden discography** that helped define what metal could be on a global scale. Very few bands can tour stadiums in 2026 while leaning this heavily on material written before most of the audience was born.\n\nFor fans looking to understand how this tour connects to the bigger picture, our in-depth breakdown of [**Iron Maiden’s discography and legacy**](/iron-maiden-discography-legacy/) explores the albums, eras, and turning points that made a tour of this scale possible — and why Maiden’s influence still feels unavoidable nearly 50 years on.\n\n## Why This Tour Matters\n\nThe *Run For Your Lives* world tour stands as a rare example of a legacy metal act continuing to evolve rather than simply revisit the past. Notably, the tour also marks Iron Maiden’s first full run without longtime drummer Nicko McBrain, following his retirement from touring in late 2024, with Simon Dawson stepping in on drums.\n\nAs Iron Maiden live performances continue to draw massive crowds across continents, the 2026 expansion further cements the band’s status as one of heavy metal’s most enduring and influential forces.\n\n**Update Note:** This article will be updated as additional Iron Maiden 2026 tour dates are announced.

    "title": "Static-X Estate Pushes Back Against Unauthorized Wayne Static Documentary",
    "content": "\nThe legacy of **Wayne Static** has once again become the focus of debate within the industrial metal world, following a public response from the Static-X family and estate regarding an upcoming documentary that has not received their authorization. As interest in Wayne Static’s life and influence continues to grow, the situation has sparked important questions about artistic intent, ownership, and how the stories of metal’s most influential figures should be preserved. More metal news: [News hub](https://metal-mantra.com/news/).\n\nAccording to representatives of the Wayne Static estate, the documentary in question is moving forward without approval from Wayne’s family or the family of his late wife, **Tera Wray**. In a strongly worded statement, the families expressed serious concerns about the project’s focus on deeply personal periods of their lives, emphasizing that these chapters represent painful experiences rather than entertainment or historical curiosity.\n\nWayne Static’s death in 2014 marked a devastating loss for the metal community, followed by the tragic passing of Tera Wray in 2016. For those closest to them, these events remain intensely private. The families argue that revisiting these struggles without consent risks reducing complex, human experiences into spectacle, particularly when Wayne’s music and artistic output already address many of the darker realities he faced.\n\n## An Official Static-X Documentary Is Already Underway, Says Estate\n\nAdding context to the dispute is the existence of an official, estate-approved documentary titled *Evil Disco – The Rise, Fall, And Regeneration of Static-X*, which is currently in post-production. This sanctioned film is intended to provide a comprehensive and respectful examination of Wayne Static’s life, the formation of Static-X, their rise during the late 1990s industrial metal boom, and the band’s evolution in the years following Wayne’s passing.\n\nThe estate has indicated that this project represents the definitive account they wish fans to see, combining archival material with firsthand perspectives from those who knew Wayne best. It is expected to explore not only the band’s success, but also the internal conflicts, personal struggles, and creative vision that defined Wayne Static’s career. More details about the official documentary have previously been discussed in coverage on [Metal Mantra](/metal-news/official-static-x-documentary), as anticipation continues to build for its eventual release.\n\n## Filmmaker Defends Separate Documentary Vision\n\nThe filmmaker behind the unauthorized project has [publicly defended](https://blabbermouth.net/news/director-of-upcoming-unauthorized-wayne-static-documentary-responds-to-estates-strenuous-objection) his work, stating that his intention is to focus specifically on Wayne Static and Tera Wray as individuals rather than on Static-X as a band. He has described the film as a personal account shaped by his relationship with the couple, arguing that it offers a different perspective than the official documentary currently being developed.\n\nWhile acknowledging the objections raised by the estate, the filmmaker maintains that both projects could exist independently, each addressing different aspects of Wayne Static’s story. However, the estate has firmly rejected this position, reiterating that any use of unreleased material, likenesses, or voice recordings connected to Wayne Static requires explicit authorization. This stance reflects a broader effort to protect Wayne’s artistic legacy from misrepresentation or unauthorized exploitation.\n\n## Wayne Static’s Enduring Influence on Industrial Metal\n\nWayne Static remains one of the most distinctive figures in industrial metal history. With the release of *Wisconsin Death Trip* in 1999, Static-X helped redefine the genre by blending mechanical grooves, electronic textures, and aggressive metal riffing into what Wayne famously described as “evil disco.” Tracks like “Push It” and “Bled for Days” became genre touchstones, while Wayne’s unmistakable vocal delivery and striking visual presence cemented his status as an icon.\n\nDespite the band’s commercial success, Static-X faced internal tensions and creative challenges that eventually led to their split in the early 2010s. Wayne’s struggles during this period were well documented through his music and interviews, offering fans an unfiltered glimpse into the pressures of life within the metal industry. His influence, however, did not fade with his passing; instead, it has continued to shape discussions around industrial metal’s evolution.\n\n## Static-X’s Modern Era and Ongoing Legacy\n\nStatic-X’s reformation in 2018 introduced a new chapter in the band’s history, one focused on honoring Wayne Static while allowing the remaining members to continue performing. Through extensive touring and the release of the *Project Regeneration* albums, the band incorporated previously recorded vocal material from Wayne, giving fans the opportunity to hear his voice on new music years after his death.\n\nThe success of these releases and tours demonstrated that Wayne Static’s influence remains deeply embedded in the band’s identity. Discussions about future music have suggested that Static-X may eventually move forward with entirely new material, but only after completing the official documentary. This measured approach reflects the care being taken to balance artistic progression with respect for Wayne’s legacy.\n\n## A Legacy Worth Protecting\n\nThe ongoing dispute surrounding the unauthorized documentary underscores a broader issue faced by many artists’ estates: determining how stories are told after death, and who has the right to tell them. For the Static-X family, protecting Wayne Static’s legacy means ensuring his life and work are presented with honesty, dignity, and proper context.\n\nAs interest in Wayne Static and Static-X continues to grow, fans remain invested not only in the music, but in the integrity of the stories surrounding it. Whether through official documentaries, live performances, or future releases, Wayne Static’s presence continues to resonate across industrial metal, reminding the scene why his impact endures decades after his rise.\n\nRelated: [An Official Static-X Documentary Is Already Underway, Says Estate](https://metal-mantra.com/official-static-x-documentary/)\n\nMore Metal Mantra: [Rundowns](https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/) | [Metal Tours](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/)\n",

    "content": "\n**The top 10 metal tracks of 2025** tell the story of a year where heavy music hit harder emotionally as it did sonically. Riffs still crushed, but vulnerability, ambition, and boundary-pushing creativity defined the conversation just as much. These are the songs that moved crowds, dominated playlists, and proved metal is still evolving rather than standing still. More metal news: [News hub](https://metal-mantra.com/news/).\n\n## [1. Pale Moonlight — Dayseeker](/track/pale-moonlight-dayseeker)\n\nDayseeker opened 2025 with cinematic weight on *Pale Moonlight*, a track that immediately felt bigger than a standard single. As the first release from *Creature in the Black Night*, it blended shimmering melodies with emotional tension, pulling listeners into a dark, atmospheric space built on restraint rather than excess.\n\nLyrically centered on toxic cycles and inner conflict, *Pale Moonlight* struck a nerve without leaning on melodrama. It wasn’t just an introduction to a new album cycle — it was a statement that Dayseeker had fully stepped into their role as one of heavy music’s most emotionally resonant bands.\n\n## [2. Specter — Bad Omens](/track/specter-bad-omens)\n\n*Specter* showcased Bad Omens at their most refined and deliberate. Built on layered production, pulsing rhythms, and a brooding sense of atmosphere, the track blurred the line between heavy music and modern alternative without losing its edge. Every element felt intentional, from the pacing to the way tension builds across the song.\n\nRather than chasing volume for impact, *Specter* relied on mood and dynamics, reinforcing Bad Omens’ evolution into a band comfortable pushing past traditional genre boundaries while still delivering weight where it matters.\n\n## [3. Dying to Love — Bad Omens](/track/dying-to-love-bad-omens)\n\nFollowing *Specter*, *Dying to Love* leaned further into emotional complexity. The track balanced soaring melodies with controlled aggression, creating a push-and-pull between vulnerability and force that resonated with both longtime fans and newer listeners.\n\nIts ability to live comfortably in both introspective listening sessions and high-energy live environments made it one of Bad Omens’ most versatile releases of the year, cementing their strong presence across 2025.\n\n## [4. Bloodlust — Dayseeker](/track/bloodlust-dayseeker)\n\nIf *Pale Moonlight* represented Dayseeker’s reflective side, *Bloodlust* was pure confrontation. Driven by aggressive rhythms and heavier instrumentation, the track delivered an unfiltered burst of intensity that felt purpose-built for live crowds and cathartic release.\n\n*Bloodlust* showed that Dayseeker’s emotional range isn’t limited to atmosphere alone — when they lean into aggression, they do so with focus and intent, never sacrificing clarity for chaos.\n\n## [5. Emergence — Sleep Token](/track/emergence-sleep-token)\n\n*Emergence* became one of the defining moments of 2025 almost immediately. Released March 13, Sleep Token’s single broke into mainstream consciousness while still retaining its experimental core, landing on major charts without sanding down its edges.\n\nThe track’s blend of delicate piano passages, crushing heaviness, and unexpected stylistic shifts made it impossible to pin down. *Emergence* didn’t just succeed commercially — it challenged expectations of what a modern heavy song could be, expanding the genre’s reach without diluting its identity.\n\n## [6. No Loss, No Love — Spiritbox](/track/no-loss-no-love-spiritbox)\n\nSpiritbox entered 2025 with precision and confidence on *No Loss, No Love*. The song’s abrupt transitions between haunting ambience and explosive heaviness highlighted the band’s comfort with unpredictability, anchored by Courtney LaPlante’s dynamic vocal performance.\n\nRather than chasing immediacy, the track rewarded close listening, reinforcing Spiritbox’s reputation as innovators who thrive in tension, contrast, and controlled chaos.\n\n## [7. Whiplash — Architects](/track/whiplash-architects)\n\n*Whiplash* reaffirmed Architects’ standing as one of modern metal’s most reliable forces. With tightly constructed riffs, driving rhythms, and an unmistakable sense of urgency, the track proved the band’s ability to evolve without abandoning their foundation.\n\nIt landed hard in live settings and heavy rotations alike, serving as a reminder that experience doesn’t soften impact — it sharpens it.\n\n## [8. End of You — Poppy, Amy Lee & Courtney LaPlante](/track/end-of-you-poppy-amy-lee-courtney-laplante)\n\nOne of the year’s most talked-about collaborations, *End of You* brought together three distinct voices from different corners of heavy music. Poppy, Amy Lee, and Courtney LaPlante combined forces on a track that felt cinematic, dramatic, and unapologetically powerful.\n\nRather than clashing, each artist’s identity elevated the others. The result was a song that felt massive without feeling forced — a rare example of crossover collaboration done right.\n\n## [9. Violent Nature — I Prevail](/track/violent-nature-i-prevail)\n\n*Violent Nature* leaned into everything I Prevail do best: massive hooks, clean production, and just enough grit to keep things grounded. The song walked the line between accessibility and aggression without tipping too far in either direction.\n\nIts staying power across playlists and live sets made it one of the most consistently played heavy tracks of the year.\n\n## [10. Sacred — Parkway Drive](/track/sacred-parkway-drive)\n\nParkway Drive closed out the list with *Sacred*, a track that felt like a reaffirmation rather than a reinvention. Built on anthemic energy, thick riffs, and undeniable momentum, it reminded listeners why the band remains a dominant live force.\n\n*Sacred* worked everywhere — in the pit, on speakers, and through headphones — the hallmark of a true late-career standout.\n\n## Final Thoughts — Why 2025 Will Be Remembered\n\nFrom chart-breaking breakthroughs to emotionally driven heavy anthems, 2025 proved metal isn’t slowing down — it’s adapting. These ten tracks captured that evolution, balancing power with purpose and aggression with honesty.\n\nIf you want to hear these songs back-to-back, check out our [2025 Picks playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch_videos?video_ids=k95oDnsCu_8,EUe9UhcUtEI,4xq5QzNG-m8,O5Io3Kbxzvs,YfKlcLKDkz0,c67cjKK_08M,3rS83uI0Wak,lCM2YxDg6OQ,8v4oxxvs8iY) and stream the tracks that defined the year.\n\nMore Metal Mantra: [Rundowns](https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/) | [Top 10 Metal Tours in 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-metal-tours-coming-in-2026/)\n\n**Listen/Buy:** [Find on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Top+10+Metal+Tracks+That+Defined+2025&#038;tag=metalmantra-20)\n",

    "content": "\nSwedish melodic death metal titans [Amon Amarth](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/amon-amarth/) and animated cult phenomenon [Dethklok](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/dethklok/) have officially joined forces for one of the most anticipated metal tours of 2026, unveiling a co-headlining North American run that merges Viking brutality with animated extreme metal spectacle. The tour, appropriately titled **The Amonklok Conquest**, will also feature rising doom metal outfit [Castle Rat](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/castle-rat/) as support, creating a lineup that blends legacy, theatricality, and underground momentum into a single night of heavy metal excess. Tickets and tour roundups live on our [Tours & Tickets hub](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/).\n\nThe Amonklok Conquest kicks off April 15, 2026 in Phoenix, Arizona at the Arizona Financial Theatre and storms across the continent before concluding May 21, 2026 in Las Vegas at PH Live at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino. Along the way, the tour will hit major markets including San Antonio, Houston, Oklahoma City, Kansas City, Minneapolis, Brooklyn, Boston, Toronto, Montreal, Atlanta, Nashville, Detroit, Denver, and Salt Lake City, delivering a full-scale production designed to satisfy fans of both crushing metal riffs and immersive stagecraft.\n\nAmon Amarth continue to stand as one of modern metal’s most consistent live forces, bringing their battle-ready anthems and Viking-themed visuals to stages worldwide. Known for albums like *Twilight of the Thunder God* and their more recent release *[The Great Heathen Army](https://amzn.to/4rZ921v)*, the band has built a career on combining melodic death metal ferocity with epic storytelling. Their live shows are equal parts concert and cinematic experience, often featuring towering stage props, synchronized lighting, and a relentless setlist built for mass chanting and raised horns.\n\nDethklok’s presence on the tour adds a different kind of spectacle altogether. Born from Adult Swim’s *Metalocalypse*, the fictional band has long since transcended animation, evolving into a legitimate touring act led by creator and multi-instrumentalist Brendon Small. With the recent release of *[Dethalbum IV](https://amzn.to/3XYuhCL)*, Dethklok’s live performances now merge high-definition animation, synchronized video elements, and crushing extreme metal into a show that feels both absurd and brutally precise. The Amonklok Conquest represents one of the largest touring platforms Dethklok has ever undertaken, cementing their place as more than a novelty act.\n\nTickets for The Amonklok Conquest go on sale to the general public Friday, December 12 at 10 a.m. local time via [Ticketmaster](https://www.ticketmaster.com), with artist presales and select venue presales available in advance. VIP packages and exclusive merchandise bundles are also expected to be offered, giving fans early access, limited collectibles, and premium experiences. Fans are encouraged to act quickly, as early demand suggests many dates could sell out rapidly.\n\n**THE AMONKLOK CONQUEST TOUR DATES:**\n\nApr 15: Phoenix, AZ – Arizona Financial Theatre\n\nApr 17: San Antonio, TX – Boeing Center at Tech Port\n\nApr 18: Houston, TX – 713 Music Hall\n\nApr 20: Oklahoma City, OK – The Criterion\n\nApr 21: Kansas City, MO – The Midland Theatre\n\nApr 22: Chesterfield, MO – The Factory\n\nApr 24: Minneapolis, MN – The Armory\n\nApr 25: Waukee, IA – Vibrant Music Hall\n\nApr 28: Brooklyn, NY – Brooklyn Paramount\n\nApr 29: Boston, MA – MGM Music Hall At Fenway\n\nMay 01: Toronto, ON – Great Canadian Casino Resort\n\nMay 02: Montreal, QC – Bell Centre\n\nMay 05: National Harbor, MD – The Theater at MGM National Harbor\n\nMay 09: Atlanta, GA – Coca-Cola Roxy\n\nMay 10: Nashville, TN – The Pinnacle\n\nMay 12: Johnstown, PA  – 1st Summit Arena\n\nMay 13: Detroit, MI – Fox Theatre\n\nMay 14: Bethlehem, PA – Wind Creek Event Center\n\nMay 16: Milwaukee, WI – Landmark Credit Union Live\n\nMay 19: Denver, CO – JUNKYARD\n\nMay 20: Salt Lake City, UT – TheUnion Event Center\n\nMay 21: Las Vegas, NV – PH Live at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino\n\nOpening each night, Castle Rat brings a distinctly different flavor to the lineup. The New York-based band has been steadily building momentum within the underground doom and heavy rock scene, thanks to their theatrical medieval aesthetic and riff-driven storytelling. Fronted by the commanding presence of the “Rat Queen,” Castle Rat’s music draws from classic doom metal, heavy rock, and fantasy imagery, creating a live experience that feels both mythic and menacing. Their 2025 release *[The Bestiary](https://amzn.to/4qaLvJd)* has helped propel them onto larger stages, and this tour marks their most high-profile exposure yet.\n\nThe Amonklok Conquest stands as more than just a tour announcement — it’s a statement about metal’s ability to evolve while honoring its roots. By pairing Amon Amarth’s time-tested Viking metal assault with Dethklok’s multimedia chaos and Castle Rat’s rising underground mystique, the tour captures multiple eras and aesthetics of heavy music under one banner. For fans of spectacle, riffs, and unapologetic metal theatrics, this is shaping up to be one of 2026’s must-see tours.\n\n**Tickets:** [Get Amon Amarth &#038; Dethklok tickets on Ticketmaster](https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3DAmon%20Amarth%20%26%20Dethklok)\n",

    "title": "Kreator Announce Spring 2026 U.S. Headline Tour With Major Festival Appearances",
    "content": "\n**Kreator 2026 tour plans are officially underway as the German thrash metal legends announce a Spring U.S. headline run with major festival appearances, marking the band’s first full U.S. run since their 2024 campaign.** The tour includes appearances at several of North America’s most high-profile heavy music festivals, including [Welcome to Rockville](https://metal-mantra.com/festivals/welcome-to-rockville/), [Sonic Temple](https://metal-mantra.com/festivals/sonic-temple/), and Maryland Deathfest, positioning the run as one of the most significant thrash-focused tours of the year. Tickets and tour roundups live on our [Tours & Tickets hub](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/).\n\nThe 2026 tour launches May 7 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and runs through May 23 in Huntington, New York, blending headline club dates with major festival stops. For a band whose legacy helped define extreme metal itself, the routing reflects Kreator’s continued relevance across both traditional thrash audiences and modern festival crowds. Tickets will be available via artist presale beginning Thursday, December 11 at 10am local time, with general onsale set for Friday, December 12 at 10am local time.\n\nKreator’s presence at **Welcome to Rockville** and **Sonic Temple** places them alongside some of the biggest names in contemporary heavy music, while their appearance at **Maryland Deathfest** reinforces the band’s deep-rooted credibility within the extreme metal underground. This dual positioning — mainstream festival stages and underground strongholds — has long been a defining trait of Kreator’s career.\n\nThe tour also supports the release of Kreator’s sixteenth full-length album, *Krushers Of The World*, due out January 16 via [Nuclear Blast Records](https://www.nuclearblast.com). The album arrives at a time when the band appear both reflective and ferocious, channeling decades of history into a release that refuses to soften its edges. Fans can [pre-order and pre-save the album here](https://kreator.bfan.link/krushers-of-the-world) and watch the video for the new single [“Satanic Anarchy”](https://youtu.be/rv9arEpXBLE?si=z-R_ctw0su7hIulQ).\n\nFounded in the early 1980s in Essen, Germany, Kreator emerged from a bleak post-industrial environment where music served as both escape and confrontation. Drawing inspiration from the New Wave of British Heavy Metal and early American thrash pioneers such as Metallica, Slayer, and Exodus, the band quickly carved out a more aggressive, confrontational strain of thrash metal that would go on to influence generations of extreme musicians.\n\nOver the decades, Kreator have not only survived but evolved, helping to radicalize thrash metal while inspiring artists across death metal, black metal, and beyond. Bands such as Arch Enemy, Cannibal Corpse, Behemoth, and even Ghost have cited Kreator’s influence, with Ghost’s Papa Emeritus famously joining the band onstage during a 2017 performance of “Satan Is Real.”\n\n*Krushers Of The World* finds the band operating at full force. Tracks such as “Seven Serpents,” “Barbarian,” and “Deathscream” deliver relentless speed and aggression, while mid-tempo crushers like the title track and “Satanic Anarchy” showcase the band’s ability to balance groove with violence. Produced by Jens Bogren at Fascination Street Studios — who previously worked with Kreator on *Phantom Antichrist* and *Gods Of Violence* — the album sounds massive, sharp, and unapologetically modern.\n\nVisually, the album also marks a notable evolution. Artwork duties were handled by acclaimed artist Zbigniew Bielak, known for his work with Ghost, who reinterprets classic Kreator visual motifs into a dense, occult-laden tapestry that pays homage to the band’s past while pushing their aesthetic forward. The result is a sleeve design that rewards close inspection and reinforces the album’s thematic weight.\n\nAs Kreator prepare to take *Krushers Of The World* on the road, the Spring 2026 tour stands as a reminder of the band’s enduring power. More than four decades into their career, Kreator remain a vital, intimidating force — equally at home leveling festival fields and demolishing packed clubs, still driven by the same uncompromising intensity that defined their earliest days.\n\n## Kreator — Spring 2026 U.S. Tour Dates\n\nMay 7 — Fort Lauderdale, FL — Revolution Live*\n\nMay 8 — Daytona Beach, FL — Welcome to Rockville\n\nMay 10 — Atlanta, GA — The Masquerade\n\nMay 11 — Knoxville, TN — The Mill & Mine\n\nMay 12 — Raleigh, NC — The Ritz\n\nMay 14 — Worcester, MA — Palladium\n\nMay 15 — McKees Rocks, PA — Roxian Theatre\n\nMay 16 — Columbus, OH — Sonic Temple*\n\nMay 18 — Davenport, IA — Capitol Theatre\n\nMay 19 — Minneapolis, MN — First Avenue\n\nMay 20 — Chicago, IL — Riviera Theatre\n\nMay 22 — Baltimore, MD — Maryland Deathfest*\n\nMay 23 — Huntington, NY — Paramount\n\n**Festival appearance*\n\n## Kreator Online\n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/KreatorOfficial)\n\n[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/kreatorofficial/)\n\n[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/Kreator/featured)\n\n[X](https://x.com/kreator)\n\n[Official Website](https://www.kreator-terrorzone.de/)\n\nFestival links: [Welcome to Rockville 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/welcome-to-rockville-2026/) | [Sonic Temple 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/sonic-temple-2026/)\n\n**Tickets:** [Get Kreator tickets on Ticketmaster](https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3DKreator)\n\n**More from Metal Mantra:** [Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/)\n",

    "title": "Bloodywood Announce 2026 “System of a Brown” U.S. Tour With The Pretty Wild, Ladrones, and Ankor",
    "content": "\n**Indian folk metal trailblazers Bloodywood have announced their 2026 North American headline run, the “System of a Brown Tour,” marking a major milestone in the band’s global ascent and their first full-length U.S. headline tour to date.** The announcement follows a breakout year that saw the New Delhi-based group move from viral success to sold-out venues, major festival stages, and high-profile support slots alongside some of modern metal’s most visible acts. Tickets and tour roundups live on our [Tours & Tickets hub](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/).\n\nProduced by Live Nation, the 25-city tour launches April 10, 2026 in Des Moines, Iowa and runs through mid-May, wrapping in Columbus, Ohio. Bloodywood will be joined by an intentionally diverse support lineup featuring U.S. metalcore act **The Pretty Wild**, Mexican “Flow Pesado” rock collective **Ladrones**, and Catalonian melodic metal band **Ankor**, reinforcing the tour’s global scope and cross-genre appeal. Tickets and VIP packages will be available via [LiveNation.com](https://www.livenation.com/artist/K8vZ917_RDV/bloodywood-events) and [Bloodywood.net](https://www.bloodywood.net/tour), with artist presales beginning Tuesday, December 9 and general onsale opening Friday, December 12 at 10am local time.\n\nThe “System of a Brown Tour” represents a full-circle moment for Bloodywood’s relationship with North American audiences. In Summer 2025, the band completed a sold-out U.S. run supporting BABYMETAL, introducing their culturally fused sound to thousands of new fans night after night. That momentum carried into Europe, where Bloodywood served as direct support for Halestorm, further proving their ability to hold their own on large stages across continents. This headline tour is the culmination of that steady rise, bringing Bloodywood’s complete live vision to U.S. venues for the first time and expanding their footprint within the broader [metal tours coverage](/news/metal-tours/) landscape.\n\n“Our spring headline run of the U.S. will be an epic full circle moment,” says rapper and vocalist Raoul Kerr. “It started this summer supporting BABYMETAL, and now it culminates in a run where we bring our full-length set to the U.S. for the first time. It’s the best songs from our new album and the best of our first album — it’s the kind of set that pushes the limit of any venue to the max.” For longtime followers of the band, the tour promises a definitive live statement rather than a scaled-down support performance.\n\nFestival appearances play a key role in anchoring the tour’s visibility, with Bloodywood set to appear at [Sick New World](https://metal-mantra.com/sick-new-world/) in Las Vegas, [Welcome to Rockville](https://metal-mantra.com/welcome-to-rockville-returns-in-2026/) in Daytona Beach, and [Sonic Temple](https://metal-mantra.com/sonic-temple-2026-festival-coverage/) in Columbus. These bookings place the band alongside the biggest names in contemporary heavy music while exposing them to massive crossover audiences, further accelerating their momentum in the U.S. market.\n\nThe support lineup reinforces Bloodywood’s identity-driven approach to heavy music. Rather than stacking stylistically similar acts, the tour brings together artists representing different regions and perspectives within the modern metal landscape. The Pretty Wild deliver a modern U.S. metalcore sound built for high-energy club rooms, Ladrones blend hip-hop cadence with heavy rock under their self-described “Flow Pesado” banner, and Ankor contribute a polished melodic metal edge rooted in the European scene. The result is a contrast-driven bill that mirrors the evolving global nature of heavy music.\n\nBloodywood’s reputation as a must-see live act has been solidified by both fan response and critical recognition. Outlets including Revolver, Metal Injection, Consequence, Guitar World, and PASTE have highlighted the band’s ability to translate cultural fusion into an explosive and cohesive live experience. Recent sold-out performances in London underscored that reputation, with crowd reactions demonstrating the universal resonance of Bloodywood’s sound regardless of geography.\n\nThe tour also continues to support the band’s latest album, *NU DELHI*, released in 2025 via Fearless Records. The album functions as both a love letter to the band’s home region and a broader statement on the future of global metal, blending nu metal, modern metalcore, melodic hard rock, and Indian folk elements into a fingerprint-distinct sound. Fans can stream the album via [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4jpCwzG4RZxPp9YbODzFqG) and explore the band’s catalog across major digital platforms.\n\n## Bloodywood — System of a Brown Tour 2026\n\n**With The Pretty Wild, Ladrones, and Ankor (festival appearances noted)**\n\nApr 10 — Des Moines, IA — Wooly’s\n\nApr 11 — Minneapolis, MN — Varsity Theater\n\nApr 13 — Denver, CO — The Oriental Theater\n\nApr 14 — Salt Lake City, UT — The Depot\n\nApr 16 — Portland, OR — McMenamins Crystal Ballroom\n\nApr 17 — Seattle, WA — Neptune Theatre\n\nApr 18 — Garden City, ID — Revolution Concert House\n\nApr 20 — San Francisco, CA — August Hall\n\nApr 21 — San Diego, CA — The Observatory SD\n\nApr 22 — Los Angeles, CA — The Belasco\n\nApr 24 — Mesa, AZ — The Nile Theater\n\nApr 25 — Las Vegas, NV — Sick New World*\n\nApr 28 — Dallas, TX — The Echo Lounge & Music Hall\n\nApr 29 — Austin, TX — Empire Garage\n\nMay 1 — Madison, WI — Majestic Theatre\n\nMay 2 — Chicago, IL — House of Blues Chicago\n\nMay 4 — Boston, MA — Paradise Rock Club\n\nMay 5 — Philadelphia, PA — Theatre of Living Arts\n\nMay 6 — New York, NY — Irving Plaza\n\nMay 8 — North Myrtle Beach, SC — House of Blues Myrtle Beach\n\nMay 10 — Daytona Beach, FL — Welcome to Rockville*\n\nMay 11 — Atlanta, GA — Buckhead Theatre\n\nMay 12 — Chattanooga, TN — The Signal\n\nMay 13 — Louisville, KY — Mercury Ballroom\n\nMay 15 — Toronto, ON — The Danforth Music Hall\n\nMay 16 — Detroit, MI — Saint Andrew’s Hall\n\nMay 17 — Columbus, OH — Sonic Temple*\n\n**Festival appearance*\n\n## Bloodywood Online\n\n[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/bloodywood.delhi/)\n\n[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/bloodywood/)\n\n[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@Bloodywood)\n\n[Official Website](https://www.bloodywood.net/)\n\n**Tickets:** [Get Bloodywood tickets on Ticketmaster](https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3DBloodywood)\n\n**More from Metal Mantra:** [Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/) | [Welcome to Rockville 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/welcome-to-rockville-2026/)\n",

    "content": "\n## **Avenged Sevenfold & Good Charlotte Announce Massive Summer 2026 North American Tour**\n\nTwo powerhouse bands from different corners of heavy music are teaming up for one of 2026’s biggest rock events. **Avenged Sevenfold** and **Good Charlotte** have [officially announced](https://www.avengedsevenfold.com/news/a7x-x-good-charlotte-2026-tour) a **co-headline Summer 2026 North American Tour**, marking a rare crossover between modern metal and pop-punk that is already generating huge excitement across the scene. Tickets and tour roundups live on our [Tours & Tickets hub](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/).\n\nThe tour will hit major amphitheaters, arenas, and outdoor venues across the U.S. and Canada beginning in early June and running well into August. This marks Avenged Sevenfold’s first major extended run since supporting their critically acclaimed album *Life Is But a Dream…*, while Good Charlotte returns to the national spotlight with fresh momentum and longstanding fan demand.\n\n## **A Bold Pairing: Metal Meets Pop-Punk**\n\nThough Avenged Sevenfold and Good Charlotte come from different sonic backgrounds, both bands dominated the 2000s alternative scene and built multi-generational followings. Fans online are already calling this one of the most unexpected — and exciting — tour pairings of the last decade.\n\nAvenged Sevenfold continue to push creative boundaries with experimental production, immersive live shows, and setlists that span their full career. Good Charlotte’s return brings anthems like “The Anthem,” “Lifestyles of the Rich & Famous,” and “I Just Wanna Live” back to major stages, tapping into intense nostalgia alongside new material.\n\n## **Tour Dates**\n\nThe full list of dates is being shared across participating outlets, with stops confirmed in major markets including Denver, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Toronto, Dallas, and more. A complete date list is expected with the official Ticketmaster and venue rollouts later this week.\n\n## **Tickets + Presale Info**\n\nPresales begin this week through the bands&#8217; official fan clubs and Live Nation, with general on-sale dates set for Friday. VIP upgrades, meet-and-greet options, and limited-edition merch bundles are expected to be available for both groups.\n\nGiven the combined drawing power of both artists — and widespread coverage from every major rock publication — demand is projected to be extremely high. Fans are strongly encouraged to secure tickets during presale windows.\n\n## **Why This Tour Matters**\n\nThis is more than a typical co-headline run — it’s a collision of two influential scenes. A7X brings progressive, theatrical metal; Good Charlotte delivers decades-defining pop-punk energy. Together, they represent a generation that shaped alternative music from Warped Tour to stadium metal.\n\nFor longtime fans — especially millennials who lived through both bands’ rise — this tour is a rare chance to see two icons share the same stage during a full nationwide run.\n\nStay tuned for updates, full tour dates, and coverage as more details emerge.\n\n**Tickets:** [Get Avenged Sevenfold 2026 tour tickets](https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Davenged%20sevenfold)\n\nMore Metal Mantra: [Metal Tours & Tickets Hub](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/) | [Top 10 Metal Tours in 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-metal-tours-coming-in-2026/)\n",

    "title": "Why Dave Mustaine Says a Full‑Lineup Megadeth Reunion Won’t Happen",
    "content": "\nThe announcement of **Megadeth**’s farewell tour and final album has set off a flurry of speculation among thrash‑metal fans.  After four decades of influence and innovation, the band is preparing to release its self‑titled swan song and embark on a multi‑continent run, culminating with what many assume will be the last Megadeth concert.  In a candid interview with SiriusXM’s *Trunk Nation*, however, frontman **Dave Mustaine** poured cold water on hopes for a full‑lineup reunion at that final show.  The longtime guitarist and vocalist explained that the “behaviour” of one former member makes it impossible to gather all surviving alumni on one stage.  Mustaine’s comments shine a light on the practical and ethical issues that come with celebrating a sprawling legacy while honouring the current musicians who carried the band through its later years.\n\n More metal news: [News hub](https://metal-mantra.com/news/).\n## What We Know About Megadeth’s Farewell\n\nMegadeth’s final chapter has been unfolding in stages.  Earlier this week the band announced *Megadeth: Behind the Mask*, a global one‑night cinema event scheduled for January 22, 2026.  The film will offer a career‑spanning retrospective and premiere the group’s long‑rumored final studio album, set for release the following day.  Tickets for the movie go on sale December 11, and the event will stream in more than a thousand theatres worldwide.  In a separate announcement, Megadeth revealed a sprawling farewell tour that will take them across the United States, Canada, South America and Europe throughout 2026.  For a band that has cycled through dozens of members since its 1983 founding, the opportunity to cap that tour with a full‑lineup reunion seemed like a fitting final act.\n\nIn his *Trunk Nation* interview, Mustaine acknowledged that fans have been asking whether the last show could include past guitarists and drummers.  He cited the example of **Marty Friedman**, the virtuoso who helped write classics such as *Rust in Peace* and *Countdown to Extinction*.  Friedman briefly rejoined the band in early 2024 for a special performance in Japan and left the door open to further collaboration.  “That was brilliant, and I love Marty,” Mustaine said, calling their time together a “very intense relationship.”  It was the first sign that the farewell campaign might include special guests.\n\n## Why a Full Reunion Isn’t on the Table\n\nWhen pressed by host Eddie Trunk on the possibility of a full reunion, Mustaine demurred.  He said that one former member’s past behaviour makes such an event impossible.  Mustaine did not name names, and he refused to elaborate on what that behaviour entailed.  Instead, he framed the decision as a matter of fairness to the musicians who currently fill Megadeth’s ranks: inviting back a high‑profile alumnus could undermine the contributions of guitarist Kiko Loureiro, drummer Dirk Verbeuren and bassist James LoMenzo, all of whom have logged years on the road and in the studio with Mustaine.\n\nThe guitarist clarified that exceptions like the appearance of Marty Friedman make sense when the chemistry is right.  But Megadeth’s long list of former members includes players who left under contentious circumstances or were dismissed for personal and professional reasons.  Mustaine suggested that reopening old wounds at the farewell show would be counterproductive.  Additionally, some alumni are no longer alive; drummer Gar Samuelson died in 1999, and more recently the community mourned the passing of former drummer Nick Menza.  That reality makes a truly comprehensive reunion impossible.\n\nSpeculation immediately turned to which former member Mustaine was referencing.  Given his past public disagreements with former bassist **David Ellefson**—dismissed from the band in 2021 after an online misconduct scandal—many fans assume the comment alludes to him.  However, Mustaine refused to confirm or deny that theory, and Ellefson has said in recent interviews that he’s not expecting an invitation back.  In fact, Ellefson defended his ex‑bandmate’s right to make the final call, noting that if Mustaine needs to walk away from the band for his own well‑being, he should do so “with dignity and grace.”  The focus, then, remains squarely on the current lineup’s ability to deliver the thrash metal ferocity that has defined Megadeth for decades.\n\n## Balancing Legacy and Loyalty\n\nFor heavy‑music historians, the reunion debate raises broader questions about how legacy bands honour their past.  **Black Sabbath** famously ended their career with the original lineup that birthed heavy metal, and fans often expect similar closure from other icons.  But Megadeth is unique: over 40 years the band has employed more than two dozen musicians, and Mustaine has always been the primary creative force.  In that sense, the brand is less a fixed lineup than a vessel for his songwriting.  A “classic lineup” reunion might appease long‑time fans but risk alienating the musicians who kept the band afloat during lean years.\n\nMustaine also hinted that the final concert could be emotionally taxing.  He joked that management should “book some fake dates” after the farewell run so that he doesn’t walk on stage and “blubber like a 175‑pound wuss.”  That self‑deprecating remark underscores the stakes: for a bandleader who has spent his life on tour, saying goodbye will be difficult even without the added drama of coordinating a parade of former members.  Fans may not get to see every ex‑Megadeth player take a bow, but they will witness Mustaine and his current bandmates close a chapter with conviction.\n\n## What Comes Next for Fans\n\nWhile Mustaine’s comments may disappoint some, there is still plenty for thrash devotees to anticipate.  The forthcoming album—rumoured to be self‑titled—will likely serve as the definitive statement of Megadeth’s current lineup.  If past releases like *Dystopia* and *The Sick, the Dying… and the Dead!* are any indicator, the new record will blend ferocious riffing with politically charged lyrics.  The cinematic experience *Megadeth: Behind the Mask* will offer unprecedented insight into the band’s history, with archival footage, interviews and a full preview of the album before its official release.  And the farewell tour itself will provide fans worldwide with a final opportunity to witness songs like “Holy Wars,” “Peace Sells” and “Symphony of Destruction” played with the precision and intensity that made Megadeth one of the “big four” of American thrash metal.\n\nUltimately, the decision to forego a full‑lineup reunion reflects both practical considerations and a commitment to the musicians who have weathered recent years alongside Mustaine. As he prepares to hang up the Megadeth banner, he appears focused on honouring his current collaborators, presenting a unified front for the band’s final act and avoiding the interpersonal conflicts that often accompany nostalgia‑driven reunions. Whether fans accept that rationale or continue to clamour for cameos, the farewell cycle promises to be one of the most closely watched stories in heavy music.

Their earlier albums — from 2017’s *Pain Again* and 2019’s *In Darkness* to 2022’s *Scars for You to Remember* — showed their continual evolution.\n\nWith *Where the Light Leaves*, the band digs deeper. Produced by longtime collaborator Josh Schroeder, the album channels ferocity, atmosphere, and emotional weight. Fans can expect destructive hardcore energy, nu-metal-tinged grooves, and haunting lyrics — a record that reflects both pain and catharsis.\n\nVarials have already proven themselves on tours with some of the scene’s hardest-hitting acts — and this album promises to bring that live intensity to recorded form again.

    "content": "\nGerman thrash metal legends Kreator have released their scorching new single “Satanic Anarchy,” taken from the band’s highly anticipated sixteenth studio album Krushers Of The World, due out January 16, 2026 via Nuclear Blast Records. More metal news: [News hub](https://metal-mantra.com/news/).\n\nThe song races forward with high speed thrash riffs, a massive, chant along chorus and a searing guitar solo, packing everything fans love about modern Kreator into just three and a half minutes of pure metal aggression.\n\nThe official “Satanic Anarchy” music video dives deep into frontman Mille Petrozza’s passion for classic horror cinema, paying tribute to Clive Barker’s 1987 cult favorite Hellraiser.

I hope you will like our brand new video for the song ‘Satanic Anarchy’ off our new album Krushers Of The World. The lyrics speak about a divine revolt of the mind, breaking the spell of obedience, standing together against tyranny and igniting change where fear once ruled. The narrative part of the video takes us back to the cinematic masterpiece Hellraiser by the great Clive Barker. This is not a remake or a sequel, it is an echo, a tribute to the raw imagination of eighties horror where pleasure, pain and chaos shared the same key. Enjoy!”\n\nBetween the track’s militant, shout along chorus and the video’s hellbound imagery, “Satanic Anarchy” is positioned as a centerpiece of Krushers Of The World and essential listening for fans of classic and contemporary thrash metal.\n\n## Krushers Of The World: track listing\n\nKrushers Of The World showcases Kreator’s continued evolution, balancing high velocity thrash assaults with dark melody, horror influenced atmosphere and massive, festival ready hooks.\n\nSeven Serpents\n\nSatanic Anarchy\n\nKrushers Of The World\n\nTränenpalast\n\nBarbarian\n\nBlood Of Our Blood\n\nCombatants\n\nPsychotic Imperator\n\nDeathscream\n\nLoyal To The Grave\n\nFrom the rabid aggression of opener “Seven Serpents” to the monumental title track and the sinister, hook heavy chorus of “Satanic Anarchy,” Kreator look set to deliver one of their most powerful and cinematic records yet.\n\n## Album formats and collector editions\n\nKrushers Of The World will be released in a wide range of formats for vinyl collectors and die hard Kreator fans, with many editions including the bonus live album Krushing Classics 1985–1990.\n\n### Deluxe vinyl box sets\n\nLimited 3LP + 2CD Digipak Deluxe Box Set (black, white and red splatter LP plus transparent red 2LP) with demon figurine and pin by Cave Toys, LP sized 24 page photo booklet, beer coaster, patch, poster and alternate box artwork.

    "title": "Avenged Sevenfold Surprise-Release New Track “Magic” for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7",
    "content": "\n[**Avenged Sevenfold**](https://www.avengedsevenfold.com/news/-magic-out-now) have pulled another signature left hook, surprise-dropping a brand-new song titled **“Magic”** — a collaborative track created for **Call of Duty: Black Ops 7** and released alongside the game’s Season 01 launch content. Without warning, the band unleashed the track across streaming platforms and a fully immersive 360° visual experience, sending fans scrambling for headphones and dissecting clues the way only the A7X community can. More reviews: [Review hub](https://metal-mantra.com/review/).\n\nThis marks the band’s first new music since their 2023 experimental record *Life Is but a Dream…*, and while **“Magic”** definitely inherits some of that album’s mind-warping DNA, it pushes into a different, more aggressive direction tailored for the Cold War–themed chaos of **Black Ops 7**. For fans wondering what the next phase of A7X might sound like, this track is a loud, glitchy clue.\n## “Magic” Track Review: Cyber-Psychedelic Heavy Metal from Avenged Sevenfold\n\n**“Magic”** kicks off with a sharp digital snarl — glitchy electronics, distorted vocal layers, and a creeping sense of unease that fits directly into the *Black Ops* universe. Then the real hit comes: a **crushing, palm-muted groove** that drops like a bunker buster. Synyster Gates’ guitar tone is dense and warped, like it has been routed through a malfunctioning AI, and the main riff swings between industrial chug, progressive twists, and psychedelic math-metal freak-outs.\n### M. Shadows’ Vocal Performance\n\n**M. Shadows** leans heavily into his modern vocal palette — half-crooned, half-snarled, processed but still expressive. The chorus slips into a surreal, almost hypnotic melody, layered with harmonies that feel both eerie and triumphant. It’s catchy but unsettling, the musical equivalent of staring down the barrel of a mind-control experiment, which fits the **Call of Duty: Black Ops 7** vibe perfectly.\n### Rhythm Section & Production\n\nBehind the chaos, **Brooks Wackerman** drives the track with explosive, stuttering drum patterns that feel almost programmed, blurring the line between organic thrash energy and cinematic battlefield tension. **Johnny Christ** locks in with a thick, mechanical bass pulse that keeps the song grounded while the guitars and electronics spiral outward.\n\nProduction-wise, **“Magic”** sits somewhere between the futuristic glitch-metal of “Game Over,” the multi-layered psychedelic weirdness of “Cosmic,” and the explosive, riff-driven swagger of the *Hail to the King* era. It’s weird, heavy, and unmistakably Avenged Sevenfold.\n## Avenged Sevenfold & Call of Duty: A Long-Running Alliance\n\n**Avenged Sevenfold** and **Call of Duty** have been creatively intertwined for over a decade. From earlier soundtrack placements to in-game appearances, the partnership has become a recurring crossover moment for both communities. With **“Magic”**, the band pushes that relationship further by crafting a track that mirrors the themes of **Black Ops 7**:\n\nCold War paranoia and psychological warfare\nDigital espionage and unseen manipulation\nHigh-tension, no-safe-space battlefield energy\nBlurring the line between reality and experiment\n\nThe lyrics and atmosphere feel perfectly aligned with *Black Ops*’ trademark narrative style — cryptic, conspiratorial, and a little unhinged. It plays like a soundtrack to mind games and double crosses, rather than a generic “metal song for a video game.”\n## Is “Magic” a One-Off or the Start of a New A7X Era?\n\nThe surprise release of **“Magic”** has fans speculating about whether this track is a standalone single or an early signal of where Avenged Sevenfold might be heading next. The band has a long history of playing by their own rules — dropping teasers, cryptic visuals, and unconventional rollouts instead of traditional album cycles.\n\nReleasing a high-profile collaboration track like this, outside of a typical album announcement, hints that A7X could be experimenting with more **singles, soundtracks, and multimedia projects** around whatever they have planned for 2026 and beyond. Historically, when Avenged Sevenfold start releasing puzzle-piece songs, more pieces tend to follow.\n## Final Thoughts: “Magic” as a Statement Track\n\nUltimately, **“Magic”** is a bold, chaotic, immersive slab of modern **Avenged Sevenfold**. It blends their most experimental instincts with a return to heavy, riff-driven aggression, wrapped in a cinematic shell that fits the **Call of Duty: Black Ops 7** universe perfectly.\n\nIt’s dark, glitchy, and psychedelic. It feels designed to live in your headphones and inside the game at the same time. For longtime A7X fans, it delivers the kind of high-concept, high-drama metal they’ve come to expect. For Black Ops players, it’s the kind of track that makes late-night sessions feel even more intense.\n\nIf this is the tone of what’s coming next from Avenged Sevenfold, 2026 might get very loud, very weird, and very fun.\n\n*Explore more [Avenged Sevenfold](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/avenged-sevenfold/) coverage.*\n\n**Listen/Buy:** [Find on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Avenged+Sevenfold+Surprise-Release+New+Track+%E2%80%9CMagic%E2%80%9D+for+Call+of+Duty++Black+Ops&#038;tag=metalmantra-20)\n",

    "content": "\n## Teen Metal Band CHAINED SAINT Release *Live at the Whisky a Go Go* EP\n\nThe **Chained Saint Live at the Whisky a Go Go EP** delivers a blistering snapshot of the teen metal band’s live power as they continue their rapid rise in modern thrash. More metal news: [News hub](https://metal-mantra.com/news/).\n\nTeen metal band **Chained Saint** — comprised of **Ethan Kahn** (guitar), **Sebastian De Avila** (bass), **Cameron Cottrell** (drums) and **Sean Sterling** (vocals) — continue their rise as one of the most exciting young forces in modern heavy music. Born in a South Florida garage in 2022, the band fuse old-school thrash metal energy with a modern, hard-hitting edge that speaks directly to the realities of today’s youth.\n\nIn just a short time, Chained Saint have earned praise from heavy-music tastemakers including **Revolver**, **Guitar World**, **Loudwire**, **Metal Injection**, and **Miami New Times**, while Judas Priest legend **Rob Halford** has publicly backed the band’s shredding chops. Their breakout single **“Animosity”** landed in rotation on **SiriusXM Liquid Metal** and soundtracked the **WWE 2K24 DLC 4** trailer, putting the teen thrashers squarely in front of a global metal audience.\n\nAlongside their studio success, the band have been building a reputation as a must-see live act. In 2024, Chained Saint hit major stages at **Welcome to Rockville**, **Rocklahoma**, **Louder Than Life**, and the revived **Vans Warped Tour**. Severe weather cut their Louder Than Life set short, but the day still turned into a viral moment when **Slaughter to Prevail** personally invited vocalist Sean Sterling to join them onstage, creating a piece of live metal history fans are still talking about.\n\nFor more breaking heavy-music coverage, festival updates, and underground discoveries, explore the [Metal Mantra Metal News](https://metal-mantra.com/category/metal-news/) hub and dive deeper into our [thrash metal](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/thrash-metal/) coverage.\n\n### About the Chained Saint Live at the Whisky a Go Go EP\n\nToday, Chained Saint level up again with the release of their new live collection, the **Chained Saint Live at the Whisky a Go Go EP**. Recorded on August 15 at the legendary Los Angeles venue, the EP documents the band’s second performance on the Whisky stage and captures the kind of high-voltage intensity that only a hungry, young metal band can generate.\n\nThe **Chained Saint Live at the Whisky a Go Go EP** captures the band’s raw, youthful intensity and showcases why they are one of the most talked-about new acts in modern thrash metal. Across the EP, Chained Saint channel the ferocity of classic ’80s thrash metal while staying locked into a modern, precise and punishing sound. It’s a snapshot of a teenage band stepping fully into their power, bridging the gap between their debut album *Blindside* and the new music set to arrive in early 2025.\n\nFans of the **Chained Saint Live at the Whisky a Go Go EP** will immediately recognize the tight musicianship and high-energy performance that has fueled the band’s rapid rise. The band says the **Chained Saint Live at the Whisky a Go Go EP** represents their most accurate live snapshot yet, giving listeners a full-throttle experience of what the band delivers onstage.\n\nFans can keep up with the band and hear more via the official [Chained Saint website](https://www.chainedsaint.com/), stream the album *Blindside* on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/2083zoQu1pm0tPTyLms72N), or explore videos on the band’s [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@chainedsaint).\n\nTo discover more music, social links, tour dates, and streaming options in one place, hit the band’s official [Chained Saint Linktree](https://linktr.ee/chainedsaint).\n\n### Band on the New Live EP\n\n“We love playing in Los Angeles and love playing at the Whisky a Go Go,” the band shares. “Besides being an iconic venue, it’s intimate, and the energy is great. And there’s nothing like playing in front of a packed house.\n\n“We talked about releasing a live EP between the *Blindside* album and the new music we’re releasing early next year. The August 15 show at the Whisky provided the perfect opportunity to show what it’s like to see us live. We were also able to capture the set on video, for all of the people who haven’t had the opportunity to see us live yet.”\n\n### *Live at the Whisky a Go Go* EP Track Listing\n\n“Free Reign”\n\n“1000 Tons”\n\n“Dark Side of the Cross”\n\n“Stronger Than Stone (Blindside)”\n\n“Animosity”\n\n### About Chained Saint and *Blindside*\n\nChained Saint formed in a South Florida garage in the summer of 2022 and quickly built a reputation for fusing the raw, organic riff power of classic ’80s thrash with contemporary heaviness. Their debut album ***Blindside***, released via independent label **Patriark Records**, distills that sound into eight tightly written tracks that hit with both technical precision and emotional weight.\n\nProduced by **William DuVall** of **Alice In Chains**, *Blindside* was recorded and mixed entirely to analog tape. There were no computers used in the recording sessions, no AI, and no studio trickery — just real riffs played by real musicians pushing themselves to capture the most honest performance possible. The result is a modern thrash metal statement that still feels timeless.\n\nFrom the raging opener **“Animosity”** to cuts like **“Stronger Than Stone (Blindside)”**, **“Neanderthal”**, and **“Free Reign”**, the record showcases the band’s ability to write hooks, riffs, and choruses that stick while keeping everything drenched in high-gain fury. For fans of classic thrash, new-school shred, and youth-driven heavy metal, Chained Saint are very much a band to watch.\n\nMetal Mantra will continue to track Chained Saint’s rise across future releases, festival appearances, and tour announcements.

    "content": "\nToday’s heavy-music news cycle is packed: surprise singles from hard-rock icons, cinematic farewell events, candid interviews from scene legends, touring plans, and cultural honors. Here’s your Metal Mantra daily rundown of what’s happening across **metal, hard rock and metalcore** right now. Catch more in the [latest Rundown](https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/).\n## Guns N’ Roses Drop Two New Singles\n\n**Guns N’ Roses** have released two new songs, “Nothin’” and “Atlas,” marking their first new material since 2023. “Atlas” roars with classic GN’R swagger while “Nothin’” offers a more introspective piano-driven approach. Both tracks are available digitally now and will see physical releases on vinyl, cassette and Japan-exclusive SHM-CD. Guitarist Slash hinted that a full-length album is in the works, though he noted it will happen organically.\n## Megadeth Announce Global Cinematic Event Ahead of Final Album\n\nThrash veterans **Megadeth** have teamed with Trafalgar Releasing for *Megadeth: Behind the Mask*, a one-night cinematic experience premiering January 22, 2026. The film will debut in over 1,000 theaters worldwide and includes a full listen to the band’s self-titled final studio album, out January 23. Tickets go on sale December 11, marking the start of Megadeth’s farewell campaign.\n## Nergal Questions Modern Arena Metal\n\nIn a new interview, **Behemoth** frontman Nergal admitted he doesn’t connect with contemporary arena-metal acts like Parkway Drive, Avenged Sevenfold and Sleep Token, calling their music “not my DNA.” He encouraged fans to catch legacy acts such as Metallica, Iron Maiden and Guns N’ Roses while they still tour, warning that the era of major hard-rock icons is coming to an end.\n## Iron Maiden’s Steve Harris Not Ready to Retire\n\n**Iron Maiden** bassist Steve Harris, who turns 70 in March, says retirement isn’t on his mind. In a conversation with Kerrang!, Harris explained he stays fit by playing football and tennis and still relishes performing. He acknowledged that the band will eventually have to consider stepping down but insisted that moment has not yet arrived.\n## Phil Campbell & The Bastard Sons Seek Permanent Singer\n\nFormer Motörhead guitarist **Phil Campbell** revealed that his band, Phil Campbell and the Bastard Sons, are still searching for a permanent vocalist following the departure of Joel Peters. With eight to ten song ideas demoed and plans to record in early 2026, the group has enlisted Fury’s Julian Jenkins as a temporary vocalist for their current European tour.\n## Opeth Drummer Shares Audition Video\n\n**Opeth** drummer Waltteri Väyrynen posted the 2022 audition video that earned him his place in the band, performing “The Devil’s Orchard.” He admitted the take isn’t perfect but said revisiting it highlights how his playing has evolved since joining the Swedish progressive-metal outfit.\n## Anthrax Finish Long-Awaited Album\n\n**Anthrax** drummer Charlie Benante confirmed that the band’s first album since 2016 is complete and expected early next year. Only one song remains to be mixed. Benante said the band pushed their sound further than ever before and promised a new single will drop before year’s end.\n## Slipknot’s Clown Pushes Album to 2026\n\nSlipknot percussionist Shawn “Clown” Crahan updated fans on the long-delayed Look Outside Your Window project—originally speculated for 2025, the experimental record is now expected in 2026, with Crahan describing it as having a Radiohead-like vibe and noting that the album has been handed over to management.\n## Mötley Crüe Outline 2026 Tour Plans\n\n**Mötley Crüe** bassist Nikki Sixx discussed the band’s upcoming 2026 “Return of Carnival of Sins” tour, noting the schedule is deliberately spaced out to reduce fatigue. The 33-date trek will feature two-week runs separated by two-week breaks. Sixx emphasized the importance of health and family time and teased new stage production alongside support acts Extreme and Tesla.\n## Birmingham Airport Rejects Ozzy Osbourne Renaming Petition\n\nThe CEO of Birmingham Airport dismissed a petition with nearly 77,000 signatures to rename the airport after **Ozzy Osbourne**. Nick Barton stated that while the airport will honor Osbourne with a mural, changing the name is not an option because it could hinder future development plans.\n\nStay on top of the latest hard rock news and events happening throughout 2026.\n\n## Your Source for Hard Rock News\n\nMore Metal Mantra: [Rundowns](https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/) | [Metal Tours](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/)\n\n**More from Metal Mantra:** [Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/) | [Top 10 Metal Tracks of 2025](https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-metal-tracks-of-2025/) | [Iron Maiden Discography &#038; Legacy](https://metal-mantra.com/iron-maiden-discography-legacy/)\n",

    "content": "\nToday’s heavy-music news cycle is packed: new 2026 tour routes, charity moves from arena giants, a major Australian festival cancellation, tech-death violence, gaming crossovers, and a posthumous honor for one of metal’s founding voices. Here’s your Metal Mantra daily rundown of what’s happening across **metal, hard rock, metalcore, and tech-death** right now. Catch more in the [latest Rundown](https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/).\n## Mammoth Announce 23-Date 2026 North American Tour\n\n**Mammoth** are locking in 2026 early with a 23-date North American tour that hits theaters and casino venues from early March through early April. Wolfgang Van Halen is clearly treating Mammoth as a full-time, road-tested band now, not a side project — and this run solidifies that energy.\n\nThe trek brings along Tennessee alt-metal veterans **10 Years** plus rising UK rockers **James and the Cold Gun**, making this a smart mix of modern hard rock and melodic heft. Expect tight rooms, big choruses, and plenty of focus on the Mammoth catalog rather than nostalgia trips. For fans eyeing the [**Mammoth 2026 tour**](https://mammoth.band/pages/tour), this looks like one of the more reliable hard-rock tickets of the early year, especially if you prefer guitars over backing tracks and casinos over crowded festival fields.\n## The Amity Affliction & August Burns Red Bring the Spring Horizons Tour\n\nOn the metalcore side, **The Amity Affliction** and **August Burns Red** are teaming up for the co-headline **Spring Horizons Tour** next spring. The package is pure crowd-killer: support from **Boundaries** and **Heavensgate**, plus a key festival stop at **Sonic Temple**.\n\nFans can expect Amity’s emotionally charged metalcore stacked against August Burns Red’s technical riff assaults, with Boundaries and Heavensgate pushing the openers into full-on breakdown territory. This is exactly the kind of smart, mid-to-large room routing that keeps the metalcore ecosystem alive — big enough to feel like an event, intimate enough that circle pits still feel personal. Get tix & vip at [Soundrink.](https://tix.soundrink.com/tours/the-springs-horizon-tour-2026)\n## Foo Fighters Schedule Birthday Benefit Show for LA’s Unhoused\n\n**Foo Fighters** are starting 2026 on a different kind of heavy. The band have booked a January 14 benefit show at LA’s Kia Forum — the date doubles as **Dave Grohl**’s 57th birthday — with proceeds going to **Hope The Mission** and **Los Angeles Mission** to support unhoused Angelenos.\n\nThe Foo Fighters have a long track record of using their platform for benefit shows, and this “**Foo Fighters Kia Forum charity concert**” continues that legacy. At a time when arena tours are under fire for VIP bloat and sky-high ticket fees, seeing a major rock act anchor a birthday around fundraising hits differently. Expect this to sell out instantly!\n## Parkway Drive Cancel Park Waves 2026 Festival Over Rising Costs\n\nIn more sobering news, Australian metalcore pillars **Parkway Drive** have officially cancelled their traveling **Park Waves 2026** festival. The band are blaming soaring touring and production costs for shutting down the run before it really started. The festival was set to feature **The Amity Affliction**, **Northlane**, and **Alpha Wolf**, making it one of the strongest Australian heavy packages on paper for next year.\n\nThis isn’t just a single event dying off. The **Park Waves festival cancellation** is another bright red warning sign for mid-to-large scale metal festivals worldwide. When a band as established as Parkway Drive can’t make the math work for a domestic festival tour, you know something’s off in the economics of live heavy music — from freight and fuel to venue overhead and insurance. For fans, it’s a reminder: when a tour or festival you care about pops up, don’t sleep on tickets. The window between “announced” and “cancelled” is getting shorter.\n## Slipknot’s Clown Launches Vernearth, a Slipknot-Themed Minecraft Realm\n\nFrom canceled festivals to digital worlds: **Slipknot** percussionist and visual architect **Clown** has launched **Vernearth**, a Slipknot-themed **Minecraft** realm running in 45-day seasons. The server features custom survival, PvP, creative, and hardcore challenge modes, giving Maggots a new way to live inside the band’s aesthetic instead of just streaming tracks.\n\nThis “**Slipknot Vernearth Minecraft server**” move makes sense: the overlap between heavy music and gaming culture is huge, and younger fans often find bands through Twitch, Discord, and game mods rather than traditional channels. It’s another example of legacy bands evolving beyond albums and tours into full-on multimedia ecosystems — graphic novels, horror experiences, and now, blocky digital chaos curated by Clown himself.\n## Iron Maiden Mark 50 Years with New Fender Signature Line\n\nOn the classic-metal front, **Iron Maiden** are celebrating 50 years by teaming up with Fender for a new signature line built around three of the band’s core players: **Dave Murray**, **Janick Gers**, and **Steve Harris**. The collection includes high-end **Stratocaster** models for Murray and Gers, plus a new **Precision Bass** honoring Harris’s unmistakable galloping low-end.\n\nFor guitar and bass nerds this drop is huge. These aren’t random vanity models — they’re built to mirror the battle-tested rigs that powered decades of tours and albums. Expect every YouTube shredder with a Union Jack flag in their background to be demoing these as soon as they land.\n## The Zenith Passage Drop “Fleshbound Reliquary” and Hit the Road\n\nTechnical death metal gets its turn via **The Zenith Passage**, who’ve unleashed a new single titled **“Fleshbound Reliquary”**. It’s the band’s first track with drummer **Max Sepulveda**, and early reactions suggest it doubles down on the intricate, sci-fi-adjacent brutality fans expect.\n\nAlongside the single, The Zenith Passage have announced a run of U.S. dates with **Entheos** and **Fallujah**, essentially building a tech-death mini-festival in club form. If you’re into polyrhythms, dissonant chords, and riffs that sound like a collapsing server room, this **The Zenith Passage Fleshbound Reliquary tour** might be your next pilgrimage.\n## Alice In Chains Pulled Into PETA’s “Betty in Chains” Elephant Campaign\n\nIn one of the stranger crossovers of the week, **Alice In Chains** have been pulled into a new **PETA** campaign asking the band to temporarily rename themselves **“Betty in Chains”**. The move is intended to raise awareness for an elderly circus elephant named Betty, which PETA claims is in urgent need of sanctuary care.\n\nWhether or not the band respond, the “**Alice In Chains Betty in Chains**” headline is already doing the awareness work PETA wants: putting animal-welfare discussions in front of rock and grunge fans who might not be plugged into circus-related activism. \n## Ozzy Osbourne Receives Posthumous Lord Mayor’s Award in Birmingham\n\nFinally, a moment of respect: the late **Ozzy Osbourne** is being posthumously honored with the **Lord Mayor’s Award** in Birmingham on what would have been his 77th birthday. The recognition salutes his defining role in heavy metal as frontman of **Black Sabbath** and his decades representing Birmingham on the world stage.\n\nFor fans, this **Ozzy Osbourne Birmingham Lord Mayor’s Award** feels like official acknowledgment of what the community has known for years — that the “Prince of Darkness” is also one of the city’s most important cultural exports. It’s a reminder that without Birmingham’s factories, pubs, and grey skies, there might never have been heavy metal as we know it.\n## Stay Plugged Into the Noise\n\nFrom new 2026 tour routes and high-end signature instruments to canceled festivals, charity shows, political activism, and game-world experiments, heavy music isn’t slowing down — it’s just mutating.

    "content": "\nAustralian metalcore heavyweights **Parkway Drive** have officially cancelled their ambitious 2026 traveling festival, **Park Waves**, citing overwhelming production and touring costs as the deciding factor. The announcement arrived before tickets went on sale or venues were finalized, abruptly halting what was shaping up to be one of Australia’s most talked-about heavy music events of 2026. More metal news: [News hub](https://metal-mantra.com/news/).\n## Why Parkway Drive Canceled Park Waves 2026\n\nAccording to statements from both **Parkway Drive** and festival promoters, the financial demands behind Park Waves escalated far beyond projections. Production expenses, staffing, staging, transport, and venue costs reportedly surged to the point that the festival became logistically and financially unsustainable.\n\nThe band emphasized that even established touring acts are struggling under current economic pressures — a problem impacting the broader 2026 touring landscape. As the metal touring industry faces increased fuel prices, inflated vendor fees, and unstable venue availability, festivals are becoming harder to execute without substantial financial risk.\n\n [ \n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n](https://www.instagram.com/p/DRvzVq3k3is/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading)\n\n[A post shared by Parkway Drive (@parkwaydriveofficial)](https://www.instagram.com/p/DRvzVq3k3is/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading)\n\n## What Park Waves 2026 Was Originally Planned to Offer\n\nThe traveling festival was designed to move across multiple Australian cities, bringing together a stacked lineup of major heavy acts including **The Amity Affliction**, **Northlane**, and **Alpha Wolf**. With rotating lineups, unique city-by-city experiences, and a focus on Australian heavy music, **Parkway Drive** positioned Park Waves as a signature event for the region’s metal community.\n\nFans had expressed massive excitement online, and early industry buzz indicated strong interest — making the cancellation even more abrupt and disappointing for the scene.\n## Impact on Fans and Supporting Bands\n\nBecause no tickets had yet been sold, fans do not need refunds. However, the abrupt nature of the cancellation leaves a gap in the 2026 Australian touring calendar. Bands such as **Northlane** and **Alpha Wolf** face the loss of major festival exposure, which could impact their year-end touring cycles, promotional plans, and album campaigns.\n\nFor many fans, Park Waves represented a rare opportunity to see Australia’s top heavy bands on the same bill — a format that is not easily replicated.\n## What This Means for Heavy-Music Festivals in 2026\n\nThe cancellation of Park Waves highlights a growing concern within the heavy-music industry: even established acts like **Parkway Drive** are not immune to economic instability. Rising production costs, insurance premiums, and supply-chain delays are affecting festivals worldwide.\n\nIndustry analysts warn that 2026 may see more cancellations or scaled-back events if current conditions persist. Fans may also notice shorter lineups, fewer stage productions, or increased ticket pricing as promoters attempt to offset financial risks.\n## No Replacement Announced — Yet\n\nAs of now, **Parkway Drive** has not revealed any alternative touring plans or replacement dates for Park Waves. While the band has expressed disappointment, they have made it clear that health and financial sustainability remain a priority.\n\nWhether Park Waves might return in future years remains uncertain, and the band has encouraged fans to monitor official channels for updates.\n\nStay locked on **Metal Mantra** for continuing updates on festival developments, touring changes, and [**metal festival news**](https://metal-mantra.com/festivals/) across 2026.\n\n**Tickets:** [Get Parkway Drive Cancels tickets on Ticketmaster](https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3DParkway%20Drive%20Cancels)\n\n**More from Metal Mantra:** [Top 10 Metal Tracks of 2025](https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-metal-tracks-of-2025/)\n",

Among the major claims, the plaintiffs allege:\n\n**Unauthorized use of likeness:** The band and its business entities allegedly continued to use former members’ images on merchandise, vinyl, posters, online listings and paid meet-and-greet packages after they left the group, without proper permission or compensation.\n**Unpaid royalties:** Several plaintiffs claim they are owed royalties for live performances, sound recordings and video appearances tied to their time in Cradle of Filth.\n**Copyright infringement:** The complaint accuses the defendants of using copyrighted works, sigils and other designs created by former keyboardist/vocalist Lindsay Matheson without approval.\n**Defamation and “toxic” work environment:** Federoff and Šmerda allege that statements made about them after they left the band were defamatory and contributed to reputational damage, while also pointing to years of alleged low pay, high stress and unprofessional behaviour from those “above” them.\n**Unjust enrichment and failure to account:** The plaintiffs say they were denied transparent accounting for merch sales, meet-and-greet income and other revenue streams while the band continued to profit from their work and likenesses.\n\nIn addition to financial damages, the lawsuit seeks to halt any further commercial use of the plaintiffs’ names, images and performances on Cradle of Filth merchandise or promotional materials.\n## Background: Departures, Contracts and Growing Tensions\n\nThe legal action follows a turbulent period for Cradle of Filth. In mid-2025, Zoë Federoff and Marek “Ashok” Šmerda exited the band mid-tour, publicly criticising what they described as low pay, high stress and “toxic” internal dynamics. Their social posts and statements included screenshots of contracts they claimed were heavily one-sided and described by their lawyer as among the harshest session agreements they had seen.\n\nShortly after their departure, Dani Filth responded with his own statement, disputing their characterisations and defending the band’s business practices. That back-and-forth set the stage for a deeper conflict that has now moved from social media into the courtroom.\n## What Dani Filth and the Band Have Said So Far\n\nAt the time of writing, official responses from Dani Filth and the defendants have been limited to prior statements addressing the broader dispute. In those comments, Filth has rejected allegations of exploitation and suggested that contracts and internal agreements have been misunderstood or misrepresented.\n\nThe lawsuit, however, escalates the conflict into a high-stakes legal battle, with the former members seeking not only monetary damages but also court orders restricting how Cradle of Filth can use historic imagery, recordings and designs connected to their time in the band.\nhere is the band&#8217;s & dani filth&#8217;s official [statement](https://www.instagram.com/p/DNv2t18xHfl/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=f9e951d8-3818-4bf9-9bfc-d746e9b26949)\n## Why This Lawsuit Matters for Metal and Music Business\n\nThe **Cradle of Filth lawsuit** taps into larger conversations about how metal and rock bands handle contracts, likeness rights and royalty splits—especially for touring and session players who may not hold equity in the core brand. For many fans, it raises hard questions about how legacy heavy bands operate behind the scenes, and whether long-term contributors are properly compensated when merch and catalog sales continue long after they leave.\n\nIf the plaintiffs prevail, the case could set a notable example around **musician likeness rights**, how older catalog imagery is used on new merch runs, and what obligations established bands have to former members when it comes to royalty accounting and intellectual property.\n## What Happens Next?\n\nThe lawsuit against Dani Filth and Cradle of Filth’s business entities is still in its early stages. The court will next work through responses from the defendants, potential motions to dismiss or narrow the claims, and any early settlement talks. Until then, all of the allegations remain just that—**allegations**—and no court has ruled on the merits of the case.\n\nMetal Mantra will continue to track filings and statements from both sides as the **Cradle of Filth lawsuit** develops.\n#### For more breaking updates from across the heavy metal and hard rock world visit our [news hub](https://metal-mantra.com/category/news/)\n",

    "title": "LION’S SHARE Return With Inferno: A Powerful Comeback 17 Years in the Making",
    "content": "\nAfter nearly two decades without a full-length studio album, Swedish heavy metal mainstays **LION&#8217;S SHARE** are finally ready to step back into the spotlight. Their new record, *Inferno*, arrives **March 27, 2026**, through **Metalville Records**, and marks a major milestone for a band whose influence stretches across the European metal scene and far beyond. More metal news: [News hub](https://metal-mantra.com/news/).\n\nFans of traditional heavy metal, melodic power metal, and the classic Swedish steel sound have been waiting a long time for this moment — and *Inferno* is shaping up to be the kind of focused, heavy, and revitalized comeback few bands ever achieve.\n## A Return Fueled by Fire, Focus, and Purpose\n\nFounding guitarist **Lars Chriss** explains the mindset behind the band’s long-awaited return:\n\n“For us, *Inferno* is more than just a new album — it’s a statement. We’ve spent years writing, refining, and pushing ourselves harder than ever. The goal was simple: make the strongest, heaviest, and most focused LION&#8217;S SHARE record of our career. I honestly feel we’ve achieved that.”\n\nVocalist **Nils Patrik Johansson**, whose unmistakable voice has become one of the band’s defining elements, echoes the sentiment:\n\n“Taking 17 years between albums wasn’t the plan — but it gave us time to reset, rebuild, and come back with absolute purpose. We’ve never sounded tighter, and we can’t wait to bring these songs to the stage. This record has everything we love about heavy metal — attitude, hooks, power. We’re incredibly proud of it.”\n\nTheir words capture the spirit of the new era: not a nostalgic reunion, but a sharpened, battle-ready LION&#8217;S SHARE stepping confidently into the present.\n## A Legacy Rooted in Swedish Heavy Metal History\n\nLION&#8217;S SHARE began in **Sundsvall, Sweden**, in 1987 — a time when Scandinavian metal was evolving rapidly, blending traditional heavy metal with emerging melodic and power metal influences. Guitarist **Lars Chriss** and keyboardist **Kay Backlund** formed the core of what would become one of Sweden’s most respected underground acts.\n\nThe band’s early years were marked by relentless rehearsals, bold songwriting, and a live presence powerful enough to earn them coveted touring spots with some of the biggest names in heavy music:\n\nMotörhead\nSaxon\nDio\nManowar\nU.D.O.\nDee Snider\n\nThese weren’t casual opportunities — they were earned through raw energy, precision musicianship, and a sound that resonated with fans of classic heavy metal around the world.\n\nOver the years, LION&#8217;S SHARE collaborated with musicians connected to **KISS**, **Megadeth**, **King Diamond**, **Candlemass**, **Symphony X**, and **Yngwie Malmsteen**, further solidifying their status as a respected force in the international metal community.\n\nAlbums like *Emotional Coma* (2007) and *Dark Hours* (2009) helped cement their reputation for blending aggressive riffing with melodic hooks, something that carries forward into *Inferno* with renewed intensity.\n## The New Era: *Inferno* (2026)\n\nToday, LION&#8217;S SHARE operates as a tight, creative partnership between **Chriss** and **Johansson**, supported by trusted musicians in both the studio and on the road. This streamlined approach has allowed the band to refine their sound and focus entirely on songwriting, production quality, and capturing the essence of what makes LION&#8217;S SHARE distinct.\n\n*Inferno* delivers exactly what its title suggests — a blazing, intense, and meticulously crafted heavy metal album that reflects decades of experience while still sounding fresh and current.\n### Album Credits\n\n**Produced & Mixed by:** Lars Chriss\n**Mastered by:** Mike Lind\n**All songs written by:** Lars Chriss & Nils Patrik Johansson\n**Artwork & Design:** Blekkmark Design Studio\n\n### Studio Lineup\n\n**Nils Patrik Johansson** – Vocals\n**Lars Chriss** – Guitars\n**Andy Loos** – Bass\n**Kay Backlund** – Keyboards\n**Anuviel (Saecred Spirit)** – Keyboards\n**Fredrik Johansson** – Drums\n\n### Live Lineup 2026\n\n**Nils Patrik Johansson** – Vocals\n**Lars Chriss** – Guitar\n**Andy Loos** – Bass\n**Magnus Ulfstedt** – Drums\n\n## Discography\n\n*Lion’s Share* (1995)\n*Two* (1997)\n*Fall From Grace* (1999)\n*Entrance* (2001)\n*Emotional Coma* (2007)\n*Dark Hours* (2009)\n*Inferno* (2026)\n\n## Connect With LION&#8217;S SHARE\n\n**Official Website:** [http://www.lionsshare.org](http://www.lionsshare.org)\n\n**Bandcamp:** [https://lionsshare.bandcamp.com](https://lionsshare.bandcamp.com)\n\n**Spotify:** [Listen on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4yIytMmJ2tx30YdMAMkDSo)\n\n**Facebook:** [http://www.facebook.com/lionsshareband](http://www.facebook.com/lionsshareband)\n\n**YouTube:** [http://www.youtube.com/lionsshare](http://www.youtube.com/lionsshare)\n\n**Instagram:** [@lions_share_band](https://www.instagram.com/lions_share_band/)\n\n**Label:** Metalville Records\n**Release Date:** March 27, 2026\n\nL to R: Lars Chriss, Nils Patrik Johansson, Magnus Ulfstedt, Andy Loos\n\n### For more new metal releases, visit our [New Release](https://metal-mantra.com/new-releases/) section.\n\n**Tickets:** [Get LIONS SHARE Return With Inferno tickets on Ticketmaster](https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3DLIONS%20SHARE%20Return%20With%20Inferno)\n\n**More from Metal Mantra:** [Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/)\n",

    "title": "Ex-I Prevail Frontman Brian Burkheiser Launches Scatterbrain With Taylor Swift Cover",
    "content": "\nFormer **I Prevail** vocalist **Brian Burkheiser** has officially re-entered the heavy-music world with the launch of his new project,\n[**Scatterbrain**](https://scatterbrain.com/), debuting with a dark, dynamic cover of Taylor Swift’s hit single\n**“Look What You Made Me Do.”** The Scatterbrain Taylor Swift cover marks Burkheiser’s first publicly released\nmusic since exiting I Prevail earlier this year and signals the beginning of a new chapter built on reinvention,\nresilience, and creative freedom. More reviews: [Review hub](https://metal-mantra.com/review/).\n## From I Prevail to Scatterbrain: A New Era for Brian Burkheiser\n\nFor roughly a decade, Brian Burkheiser helped define **I Prevail**’s sound as the band’s clean vocalist, blending\nsoaring melodies with crushing metalcore arrangements. The band rose quickly from viral fame to festival main stages,\nearning gold-certified singles and even a Grammy nomination along the way. When I Prevail announced earlier this year that\nthey had “mutually parted ways” with Burkheiser, it closed a major chapter for both the singer and the band.\n\nAfter the split, Burkheiser addressed fans directly to clarify that personal and family factors played a role in his\ndeparture and that there was no bad blood despite online speculation. What followed was a stretch of relative quiet:\nteasers, cryptic posts, and hints that he was working on something new under a different name.\n\nThat name is **Scatterbrain** — a project that allows Burkheiser to step outside the confines of genre and\nexpectation. While I Prevail continues forward with new music and touring plans, Scatterbrain represents a clean slate,\nand the Taylor Swift cover is the first official statement of intent.\n## Legal Roadblocks, Delays, and the Drive to Create\n\nThe road to Scatterbrain’s debut hasn’t been simple. In late summer, Burkheiser revealed that an unresolved dispute\nconnected to his former band was preventing him from releasing new original music, including a song titled\n*“Phases.”* For fans who had been eagerly waiting to hear what Brian Burkheiser would sound like outside of\nI Prevail, it was a frustrating development.\n\nInstead of going silent, Burkheiser decided to pivot. If original material needed to wait, he would find another path\nto reconnect with listeners. That path became this Scatterbrain Taylor Swift cover — a way to share something that felt\nemotionally honest, creatively exciting, and symbolically important without adding more fuel to any legal complications.\n## The Scatterbrain Taylor Swift Cover: “Look What You Made Me Do” Reimagined\n\nThe new Scatterbrain release reimagines Taylor Swift’s **“Look What You Made Me Do”** as a tense,\ncinematic, alt-rock and metal-infused track. Where the original leans into sly pop minimalism and dark swagger,\nScatterbrain pushes the song toward a more dramatic, guitar-forward, and emotionally charged space.\n\nThe choice of song isn’t accidental. “Look What You Made Me Do” is a track about reclaiming narrative, shedding past\nversions of yourself, and standing firm in a new identity — themes that mirror where Brian Burkheiser is in his career.\nIt’s both a musical statement and a personal one, aligning perfectly with the launch of Scatterbrain.\n## Official Statement: Brian Burkheiser on Scatterbrain and His First Release\n\nAlongside the release, Burkheiser shared a heartfelt message to fans as part of the official Scatterbrain press announcement:\n\n**“To my fans:**\n\nThis year forced me to pivot in ways I never expected, and it tested me more than I can explain.\nBut through it all, your support has meant everything.\n\nI&#8217;m excited to finally share a song with you. I chose this cover because it truly resonates with me\nand serves as a nod to what first sparked my career.\n\nI&#8217;m still working toward the day I can release my original music, but for now, I&#8217;m grateful to have\nfound a way to put a piece of art into the world.\n\nThe statement underlines just how personal this release is. The Scatterbrain project isn’t a casual side quest; it’s\nthe vehicle for Burkheiser’s creative rebirth, forged during one of the most challenging years of his life.\n## What Scatterbrain Means for Fans of I Prevail and Modern Metal\n\nFor fans who discovered Brian Burkheiser through I Prevail’s blend of metalcore, post-hardcore, and modern rock,\nScatterbrain offers a familiar emotional weight in a new package. Early descriptions of the project emphasize a fusion\nof rock, hip-hop, pop, electronic elements, and everything in between — a genre-fluid approach that mirrors how many\nheavy-music listeners consume music today.\n\nWhile I Prevail moves ahead with their own evolution, Scatterbrain allows Burkheiser to explore more experimental,\npersonal, and stylistically diverse material. The Taylor Swift cover feels like a mission statement:\nhe’s not interested in repeating his past — he’s interested in transforming it.\n## What’s Next for Scatterbrain?\n\nThe big question now is what comes after this Taylor Swift cover. Fans are still anticipating the official release of\noriginal Scatterbrain songs like *“Phases,”* which were delayed by earlier disputes. Burkheiser has been open\nabout wanting to share that material as soon as he can.\n\nIn the meantime, Scatterbrain’s debut sends a clear message: Brian Burkheiser is not quietly slipping away from the\nscene. He’s stepping back into it with a sharpened focus, a new sound, and a project built entirely on his own terms.\nWhether the next chapter brings more covers, original singles, or a full album, Scatterbrain is now officially in play\n— and the heavy-music world will be watching.\n\nFor more heavy-music updates, visit our [Metal & Hard Rock News](https://metal-mantra.com/category/news/) section.\n",

    "content": "\nRock icons **Evanescence** have officially announced a massive **2026 world tour**, marking their most ambitious global run in years. The tour begins with a **full North American leg in June 2026** before expanding into a major UK and European arena campaign in the fall. The run features a rotating support lineup including **Spiritbox**, **Poppy**, **Nova Twins**, and **K.Flay**, making this one of the strongest alternative-heavy packages of the upcoming touring year. Tickets and tour roundups live on our [Tours & Tickets hub](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/).\n## North American Leg Begins June 2026\n\nThe 2026 world tour launches first in the **United States**, with Evanescence headlining across multiple major markets. While the full routing has not yet been revealed, industry reports confirm that the North American leg begins in **June 2026** and is expected to hit key cities across the U.S. and Canada.\n\nSupport for the North American dates is expected to include **Spiritbox** and **Poppy**, building on the groups’ recent collaborative momentum. Evanescence fans in the States will finally see the band return with a large-scale, full-production tour for the first time in years, with more details expected in the coming weeks.\n## 2026 UK & European Arena Dates\n\nFollowing the North American run, Evanescence will head overseas for a **UK and European arena tour** taking place between **September 8 – October 4, 2026**. The band will perform in major arenas across the UK, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal and more.\n\nThe European leg features a region-specific support rotation:\n\n**Poppy** – appearing on all UK & European dates\n**K.Flay** – supporting the UK shows\n**Nova Twins** – supporting the European mainland dates\n\nEarly registration interest indicates especially high demand in London, Paris, Berlin, Amsterdam and Madrid.\n## Amy Lee on the Tour: Fire, Energy & a New Creative Cycle\n\n**Amy Lee** has described the upcoming world tour as a “reignited era” for Evanescence — one driven by fresh inspiration, creative partnerships and a renewed focus on theatrical live performance. Lee’s recent comments indicate that the band’s 2026 output may tie closely into the tour, hinting at **new music** arriving ahead of or alongside the dates.\n\nThe inclusion of Spiritbox, Poppy, Nova Twins and K.Flay reflects Evanescence’s ongoing interest in cross-genre collaboration and modern heavy music. Together, they shape a diverse lineup spanning alt-metal, electronic rock, punk-infused bass music and genre-bending alternative.\n## Support Acts: A Multi-Genre Heavy Powerhouse\n\nThe 2026 world tour features one of the most eclectic and forward-thinking support bills Evanescence has assembled to date:\n\n**Spiritbox** — a leading force in modern metalcore and progressive heavy music\n**Poppy** — bringing industrial-tinged, avant-garde alt-metal energy\n**Nova Twins** — delivering a fierce blend of punk, grime and bass-driven rock\n**K.Flay** — offering a sharp, emotionally charged alternative rock/hip-hop hybrid\n\nNot every act will appear on every stop, but the overall package positions Evanescence’s 2026 cycle as one of the most musically diverse tours of the year.\n## Tickets, Pre-Sales & Registration\n\nTickets for the UK and European dates are already surfacing through venue partners and ticketing outlets. North American ticketing is expected to go live next, and fans are encouraged to register early for pre-sale access at:\n\n[https://www.evanescence.com/evanescence-shows/](https://www.evanescence.com/evanescence-shows/)\n\nThe band is once again partnering with **PLUS1**, with a portion of ticket proceeds supporting humanitarian and medical relief efforts.\n## What This Means for Evanescence’s Next Era\n\nWith a major North American return, a massive European arena run, and strong indicators of new music on the horizon, Evanescence’s 2026 world tour marks the beginning of a bold new chapter. It brings together multiple generations of heavy and alternative artists, while placing Evanescence back in the global spotlight in a big, high-production way.\n\nFor full routing, support act confirmations, ticket links and breaking updates as they’re announced, keep watching **Metal Mantra** — your source for fast, accurate heavy music news.\n\n**Evanescence 2026 Tour Dates:**\n04/25 – Las Vegas, NV @ Sick New World Festival\n06/11 – West Palm Beach, FL @ iTHINK Financial Amphitheatre *\n06/12 – Tampa, FL @ MIDFLORIDA Credit Union Amphitheatre *\n06/14 – Alpharetta, GA @ Ameris Bank Amphitheatre *\n06/15 – Nashville, TN @ Bridgestone Arena *\n06/17 – Raleigh, NC @ Coastal Credit Union Music Park at Walnut Creek *\n06/18 – Charlotte, NC @ PNC Music Pavilion *\n06/20 – Camden, NJ @ Freedom Mortgage Pavilion *\n06/21 – Mansfield, MA @ Xfinity Center *\n06/23 – Saratoga Springs, NY @ Saratoga Performing Arts Center *\n06/24 – Wantagh, NY @ Northwell at Jones Beach Theater *\n06/26 – Holmdel, NJ @ PNC Bank Arts Center *\n06/27 – Bristow, VA @ Jiffy Lube Live *\n06/29 – Toronto, Ontario @ RBC Amphitheatre *\n06/30 – Montréal, Quebec @ Centre Bell *\n07/08 – Tinley Park, IL @ Credit Union 1 Amphitheatre *\n07/09 – Noblesville, IN @ Ruoff Music Center *\n07/11 – North Little Rock, AR @ Simmons Bank Arena *\n07/12 – Kansas City, MO @ MORTON Amphitheater *\n07/14 – Albuquerque, NM @ Isleta Amphitheater *\n07/15 – Phoenix, AZ @ Talking Stick Resort Amphitheatre *\n07/17 – Chula Vista, CA @ North Island Credit Union Amphitheatre *\n07/18 – TBA\n07/20 – Mountain View, CA @ Shoreline Amphitheatre *\n07/22 – Ridgefield, WA @ Cascades Amphitheater *\n07/23 – Auburn, WA @ White River Amphitheatre *\n07/25 – Salt Lake City, UT @ Utah First Credit Union Amphitheatre *\n07/28 – St. Louis, MO @ Hollywood Casino Amphitheater *\n07/30 – Cuyahoga Falls, OH @ Blossom Music Center *\n08/01 – Cincinnati, OH @ Riverbend Music Center *\n08/02 – Clarkston, MI @ Pine Knob Music Theatre *09/08 – Leeds, UK @ First Direct Arena +\n09/10 – Manchester, UK @ Co-op Live +\n09/11 – Birmingham, UK @ Utilita Arena Birmingham +\n09/13 – London, UK @ The O2 +\n09/16 – Brussels, Belgium @ Forest National #\n09/18 – Paris, France @ Accor Arena #\n09/19 – Frankfurt, Germany @ Congress Center Messe Frankfurt #\n09/20 – Dortmund, Germany @ Westfalenhallen Dortmund #\n09/22 – Amsterdam, Netherlands @ Ziggo Dome #\n09/23 – Hamburg, Germany @ Barclays Arena #\n09/25 – Berlin, Germany @ Velodrom #\n09/26 – Munich, Germany @ Olympiahalle #\n09/28 – Bologna, Italy @ Unipol Arena #\n09/29 – Zurich, Switzerland @ Hallenstadion Zurich #\n10/01 – Barcelona, Spain @ Palau Olimpic Badalona #\n10/02 – Madrid, Spain @ Palacio Vistalegre #\n10/04 – Lisbon, Portugal @ MEO Arena #\n10/24 – Forth Worth, TX @ Sick New World Festival\n10/26 – Morrison, Colorado @ Red Rocks Amphitheatre ^\n\n* = w/ Spiritbox and Nova Twins\n+ = w/ Poppy and K.Flay\n# = w/ Poppy and Nova Twins\n^ = w/ K.Flay\n\nRelated tours: [Poppy 2026 North American Tour Dates](https://metal-mantra.com/poppy-2026-north-american-tour-dates/) | Festival tie-in: [Sonic Temple 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/sonic-temple-2026/)\n\n**Tickets:** [Get Evanescence tickets on Ticketmaster](https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3DEvanescence)\n\n**More from Metal Mantra:** [Top 10 Metal Tracks of 2025](https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-metal-tracks-of-2025/) | [Sick New World 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/sick-new-world/)\n",

    "title": "Metal &amp; Hard Rock News – November 27, 2025: Scene Movement &amp; Unconfirmed Reports",
    "content": "\nThe past day in heavy music hasn’t delivered many concrete announcements, yet the underground is alive with credible chatter and fast-shifting speculation. This edition of the Metal Mantra Rumor Watch takes a deeper dive into the conversations circulating across fanbases, insider groups, and active scene communities. None of these items are confirmed, but each represents the type of early movement that frequently precedes major developments. As the year closes out, the rumor mill is accelerating, and today’s signals feel louder than usual. Catch more in the [latest Rundown](https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/).\n\n## Gojira Album Timeline Sparks Ongoing Speculation\n\nFollowing **Joe Duplantier**’s hand surgery and the temporary addition of **Greg Kubacki** of Car Bomb for live duties, speculation around the next **Gojira** album cycle has intensified. Fans are openly questioning whether internal schedules have shifted behind the scenes, especially given the band’s reputation for deeply layered, detail-oriented studio work.\n\nThe band’s continued silence across official channels isn’t helping the uncertainty. Many followers believe the lack of communication signals something brewing rather than nothing happening at all. Whether that points to extended recovery time, additional writing sessions, or a strategic hold remains purely speculative.\n\n## Slipknot Fans Expecting a Major Announcement\n\nSlipknot’s digital footprint has shifted subtly but noticeably, and fans are treating it as smoke before fire. Small changes in member behavior, reduced downtime on socials, and a general uptick in behind-the-scenes activity have sparked theories ranging from lineup confirmations to a new era rollout. Even without official confirmation, the energy around the band feels markedly different from the usual quiet periods.\n\nLong-time followers recognize the familiar tension that tends to rise just before the band unveils something significant. Whether that’s new music, a tour reveal, or branding for their next chapter, anticipation is building fast across the community.\n\n## Growing Buzz Around Lorna Shore’s Next Release\n\n**Lorna Shore** has entered one of their signature silent phases, which fans historically associate with the lead-up to major announcements. Their unpredictability has only amplified speculation, with conversations ranging from a surprise single to the early stages of a new album cycle. After their explosive recent run of success, the pressure and interest surrounding their next move are higher than ever.\n\nThe band’s fanbase is extremely active even during downtime, and this has created a feedback loop of excitement, theories, and heightened expectations. Until official word breaks, every small change in their digital presence is being scrutinized closely.\n\n## Megadeth Farewell Tour Rumored to Expand\n\nWith **Megadeth**’s [Canadian farewell tour](https://www.megadeth.com/blogs/news/megadeth-to-embark-on-canadian-headline-tour-with-anthrax-exodus?srsltid=AfmBOopR009udwndc1z0tkKBMFp6V6r8fAMq4wadNbQSseQ1eZFyxXOM)—supported by **Anthrax** and **Exodus**—already generating massive demand, rumor threads suggest the band may add additional U.S. dates. Several major American markets absent from recent routing have been vocal about wanting a place on the tour, adding to the speculation that the current run may not be the final version.\n\nFarewell tours often shift and expand in response to fan demand, and Megadeth’s history of adapting schedules makes the idea even more plausible. Fans are watching for any hint of expansion, especially in areas overdue for a visit.\n\n## Amon Amarth European Routing May Grow\n\n[as previously reported,](https://metal-mantra.com/metal-hard-rock-news-november-24-2025/) **Amon Amarth**’s 2026 European tour is shaping up to be one of the strongest ticket-moving lineups of the coming year. Early demand has already sparked discussions about extending the run into early 2027, possibly with a refreshed support roster. The band’s reputation for delivering massive, high-production shows has only amplified hopes among fans eager for additional dates.\n\nThe momentum surrounding the current tour package suggests that expansion is more than just wishful thinking. As pre-sales continue to move quickly across multiple markets, industry watchers are keeping a close eye on regions that traditionally sell out fastest.\n\n### Stay Connected\n\nFollow **Metal Mantra** daily for confirmed headlines, ongoing rumor tracking, tour developments, release cycles, and evolving stories from across the heavy music world. As the scene shifts, we’ll continue cutting through noise, spotlighting credible chatter, and delivering accurate updates the moment they break.\n\n## **More Metal News & Hard Rock Updates**\n\n**More from Metal Mantra:** [Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/)\n",

    "title": "Metal &amp; Hard Rock News – November 24, 2025: Arch Enemy Shake-Up, New HEALTH Single, Amon Amarth Tour",
    "content": "\nThe metal world is buzzing again this week, and today’s **metal news** recap brings major lineup shifts, massive tour reveals, and a wave of heavy new releases across the scene. November has already proven to be one of the busiest months of 2025 for metal and hard rock fans, and this latest round of updates only intensifies the momentum. Catch more in the [latest Rundown](https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/).\n\n## **Today’s Metal News: Alissa White-Gluz Leaves Arch Enemy After 11 Years**\n\n🎤 In one of the most talked-about stories in recent **metal news**, Alissa White-Gluz has officially parted ways with *Arch Enemy* after more than a decade fronting the band. Her powerful vocals and commanding stage presence helped define the band’s modern era, shaping three studio albums, multiple world tours, and a new generation of fans.\n\nAlongside her departure, Alissa released a hauntingly cinematic solo single titled *“The Room Where She Died.”* The song leans into a darker, more dramatic atmosphere with orchestral layers, clean-vocal passages, and some of her most emotional lyric work to date.\n\nFans immediately questioned whether this marks the start of a full-scale solo era — and based on the single’s reception, that seems extremely likely. Conversations across social media suggest that many listeners felt the song reflects musical ideas she may not have been able to fully explore within Arch Enemy.\n\n### **Who Will Replace Alissa?**\n\n📣 As expected, speculation across the **metal news** community is exploding. No official announcement has been made regarding a new vocalist, which has left room for fan theories:\n\nA return from a former Arch Enemy vocalist\n\nA surprise choice from another well-known metal band\n\nA complete newcomer from the underground scene\n\nUntil the band issues a formal statement, the mystery remains one of the biggest open questions in modern melodic death metal.\n\n## **HEALTH Release Crushing New Single “SHRED ENVY”**\n\n🎧 Industrial-metal innovators **HEALTH** have dropped one of their heaviest tracks ever: *“[SHRED ENVY.”](https://youtu.be/D3ApCSWCoVU?si=-1pEdpcWJ1qMjyX9)* The song blends the band’s signature electronic distortion, noise-rock aggression, and metallic intensity into a brutal, fully weaponized production that immediately captured attention across the heavy-music world.\n\nThe track’s official music video dives deep into industrial-horror aesthetics, featuring frantic energy and visual nods to *Chainsaw Man.* Fans have praised the direction as bold, violent, and refreshingly chaotic — exactly what HEALTH excels at.\n\n### **HEALTH Announce 2026 North American Tour**\n\nAlongside the single, the band confirmed a massive **2026 North American tour**, marking a major cycle for their next era. Early teasers hint at an expanded stage show, upgraded lighting rigs, and the band’s most intense setlist yet. With the success of *“SHRED ENVY”*, this tour is expected to be one of the standout industrial-metal events of the year.\n\n## **Amon Amarth Expand Their 2026 “Allfather Awakens” Tour**\n\n🛡️ Viking metal giants **Amon Amarth** have added several new dates to their upcoming 2026 UK/EU **“Allfather Awakens”** tour. New stops include London, Manchester, Antwerp, Lyon, and Warsaw. Known for their cinematic storytelling, massive pyro effects, and stadium-sized riffs, Amon Amarth continue their rise as one of Europe’s biggest heavy-music touring acts.\n\nTheir ability to merge melodic death metal with Norse mythology has kept them at the forefront of the scene, and this tour expansion proves just how strong the demand remains across Europe.\n\n## **Heavy-Music Release Calendar: A Huge Week for Fans**\n\n📅 This week’s updated heavy-music release calendar includes dozens of new albums and singles across black metal, metalcore, industrial, and hard rock. Several underground acts are dropping debut EPs, while veteran bands are releasing late-year singles before the 2026 cycle begins.\n\nFrom atmospheric black metal and crushing deathcore to 80s-inspired hard-rock revival tracks, the variety makes this one of November’s most exciting release weeks. Fans looking to stay updated on all new releases can browse our **[New Releases](https://metal-mantra.com/new-releases/)** section\n\nThe final weeks of 2025 continue to deliver nonstop announcements, new music, and shifts in the heavy-music landscape. Between Alissa’s departure from Arch Enemy, HEALTH’s brutal return, and Amon Amarth’s expanded tour, this cycle has already set the stage for a massive year ahead.\n\n## **More Metal News & Hard Rock Updates**\n\n**More from Metal Mantra:** [Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/)\n",

    "title": "Iron Maiden Discography &#038; Legacy: Ranking the Albums",
    "content": "\nIron Maiden&#8217;s discography is a towering legacy in heavy metal, spanning **17 studio albums** from their self-titled debut in 1980 to their latest epic in 2021. Over more than four decades, the band evolved from the raw [New Wave of British Heavy Metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_wave_of_British_heavy_metal) sound of their early days to the elaborate progressive epics of recent years, selling over [100 million records worldwide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Maiden) and influencing countless artists along the way. Every fan has their own opinion on which albums reign supreme. Here, on our fan-driven site, we&#8217;re taking on the challenge of ranking Iron Maiden’s studio albums from worst to best – a subjective journey through [Iron Maiden](https://ironmaiden.com) history that celebrates the highs, notes the lows, and honors the band&#8217;s unparalleled legacy. More metal news: [News hub](https://metal-mantra.com/news/).\n\nEach album contributed something to Iron Maiden’s story, whether it was a lineup change, a bold musical experiment, or a classic that defined a generation. From the [Blaze Bayley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaze_Bayley)-era struggles in the 1990s to the triumphant [Bruce Dickinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Dickinson)-led reunion albums of the 2000s, from the anthems that fill stadiums on tour to deep cuts beloved by diehards – they’re all part of the legacy. Strap on your bullet belt and grab your Eddie posters: let&#8217;s dive into Iron Maiden’s catalogue and see how the albums stack up.\n\n## 17. Virtual XI (1998)\n\nIt’s no surprise that *Virtual XI* lands at the bottom of our list. The second (and final) Iron Maiden album with vocalist Blaze Bayley, *Virtual XI* suffered from a lack of inspiration and identity. Coming off the lukewarm reception of *The X Factor*, the band attempted to recapture old glory, but the result was widely seen as a misstep. The production is oddly weak and the songwriting feels flat. Even a few decent moments – “The Clansman” in particular is a rousing epic that survived in live sets with Bruce back on vocals – can&#8217;t save the album from its reputation. “The Angel and the Gambler,” with its endlessly repeated chorus, has become infamous among fans for all the wrong reasons. Every great band has a low point, and for many, *Virtual XI* is it. (If you&#8217;re still curious or completing your collection, *Virtual XI* is available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+Virtual+XI).)\n\n## 16. The X Factor (1995)\n\nIron Maiden’s first album without Bruce Dickinson was *The X Factor*, introducing Blaze Bayley as frontman. Blaze had a distinctly different, darker vocal style, and the band’s music followed suit – *The X Factor* is a sombre, brooding affair. To its credit, the album dared to be different, with longer songs and introspective lyrics reflecting a turbulent time for band leader Steve Harris. “Sign of the Cross” is an 11-minute centerpiece that showed Iron Maiden could still write grand epics (Bruce would later sing it live to great effect), and “Lord of the Flies” and “Man on the Edge” are solid tracks. However, the overall tone is unrelentingly dark and the energy level never quite reaches the galloping highs Maiden is known for. Many fans appreciate *The X Factor* for its atmosphere, but others find it a difficult listen. It remains a polarizing entry in the discography, and in our ranking it only rises above *Virtual XI*. (Find *The X Factor* on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+X+Factor) if you&#8217;re looking to explore this chapter of Maiden history.)\n\n## 15. No Prayer for the Dying (1990)\n\nAfter an incredible run of classic albums in the 1980s, Iron Maiden hit a bump in the road with *No Prayer for the Dying*. This 1990 release saw a major lineup change – guitarist Adrian Smith departed, and Janick Gers stepped in. The band also stripped down their sound, aiming for a rawer, more straightforward heavy metal approach after the polished, synth-infused production of the late &#8217;80s. The result was a mixed bag. On the one hand, *No Prayer* gave Maiden their first (and only) UK #1 single with the tongue-in-cheek “Bring Your Daughter… to the Slaughter.” It also features fan-favorite “Holy Smoke”, a cheeky rocker, and a soulful title track “No Prayer for the Dying.” On the other hand, much of the album felt undercooked compared to what came before. Bruce Dickinson’s vocals were noticeably rougher as he experimented with a raspier style, and the songwriting lacked the epic scope of earlier records. While not without its charms, *No Prayer for the Dying* is often regarded as a downgrade from the brilliance of the 1980s albums. (You can revisit *No Prayer for the Dying* on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+No+Prayer+for+the+Dying) and decide if it’s an underrated gem or rightly ranked low.)\n\n## 14. Fear of the Dark (1992)\n\nIron Maiden closed out their first Bruce Dickinson era with *Fear of the Dark*, an album that splits opinion among fans. On release in 1992, it received a warm commercial reception (even hitting #1 on the UK charts), but critically it showed signs of creative fatigue. *Fear of the Dark* is notably uneven: it contains some absolute killers along with some filler that drags it down. On the bright side, the iconic title track “Fear of the Dark” has become one of Iron Maiden’s greatest live anthems – its eerie intro and galloping climax drive crowds wild, and it&#8217;s a staple in concert setlists. Other strong cuts include “Afraid to Shoot Strangers”, with its dynamic build-up, and “Be Quick or Be Dead”, a frantic opener that proved Maiden could still thrash with the best of them. However, the album is padded with songs like “Weekend Warrior” and “Chains of Misery” that are generally forgotten even by dedicated fans. Following this album, Bruce Dickinson left the band for a few years, making *Fear of the Dark* a poignant end to an era. While it’s far from Maiden’s worst, its inconsistency lands it in the lower half of our list. (If you need *Fear of the Dark* in your collection, it&#8217;s available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+Fear+of+the+Dark).)\n\n## 13. Dance of Death (2003)\n\nThe early 2000s saw Iron Maiden enjoying a rejuvenation, but *Dance of Death* stands as a somewhat awkward follow-up to the triumphant *Brave New World*. Released in 2003, this album continued Maiden’s foray into longer, progressive-leaning songs, with mixed results. It’s impossible not to mention the cover art – a bizarre CGI mishmash that many fans consider the worst cover in Maiden’s catalog – but beneath that, *Dance of Death* has its highlights. “Paschendale,” for instance, is an absolute masterpiece: an epic retelling of a World War I battle, rich with atmosphere and one of Maiden’s best post-2000 songs. The title track “Dance of Death” is another standout, a story-driven piece that harks back to the theatrical feel of old classics. There are also fun, shorter tracks like “Wildest Dreams” and “Rainmaker,” which the band took on tour. However, not every song hits the mark (tracks like “Gates of Tomorrow” or “New Frontier” are often overlooked), and the production feels a bit muddy. Overall, *Dance of Death* ranks mid-to-low in Maiden’s discography – worthwhile for its high points, but uneven enough to keep it out of the top tier. (Check out *Dance of Death* on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+Dance+of+Death) to hear its unique blend of the great and the not-so-great.)\n\n## 12. The Final Frontier (2010)\n\nOn *The Final Frontier*, Iron Maiden took their sound to outer space – literally and figuratively. This 2010 album has a futuristic theme, kicking off with the experimental intro “Satellite 15&#8230; The Final Frontier” that surprised many fans with its droning bass and echoing drums before exploding into a classic Maiden gallop. *The Final Frontier* is an ambitious effort that earned the band a lot of late-career recognition: it debuted at #1 in 20+ countries and even garnered Iron Maiden their first Grammy Award (for the stomping single “El Dorado”). Musically, the album continues the band&#8217;s progressive streak, with lengthy tracks like “When the Wild Wind Blows” and “Isle of Avalon” showcasing elaborate structures and introspective themes. There are plenty of highlights – “Coming Home” is a heartfelt, nostalgic anthem and “The Talisman” delivers vintage galloping drama – yet the album as a whole can feel a bit overlong and dense. Some fans feel *The Final Frontier* could have been trimmed for greater impact, but it’s undeniably a strong record that proved Maiden’s endurance. In our ranking, it sits lower mid-pack, reflecting an album that, while impressive, doesn’t quite reach the heights of the band’s very best work. (Explore *The Final Frontier* on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+Final+Frontier) if you want to experience Maiden’s space-bound adventures.)\n\n## 11. A Matter of Life and Death (2006)\n\n*A Matter of Life and Death* is often praised as one of Iron Maiden’s most cohesive and mature albums. Released in 2006, it presents a loosely war-themed collection of songs wrapped in a gritty, almost live-sounding production. Notably, the band was so confident in the material that they performed the entire album on tour — a bold move that split fan opinions at the time. The album itself is a grower: from the rallying cry of “Different World” to the intense build of “The Longest Day” and the philosophical weight of “For the Greater Good of God,” every track unfolds with purpose. The songwriting is deep and progressive; tracks like “Brighter Than a Thousand Suns” and “The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg” showcase complex structures and dark, heavy riffs that harken back to Maiden’s 80s epics, but with a modern twist. While *A Matter of Life and Death* didn’t produce any radio singles and eschewed any overt “hits,” it holds together as an album experience and has earned immense respect from fans who appreciate its depth. Its consistency and ambition earn it a solid spot just outside the top ten in our ranking. (If you’re interested in this powerful chapter of Maiden’s catalog, you can find *A Matter of Life and Death* on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+Matter+of+Life+and+Death).)\n\n## 10. The Book of Souls (2015)\n\nIn 2015, Iron Maiden proved they still had grand creative ambitions with *The Book of Souls*, their first double studio album. Clocking in at over 90 minutes, *The Book of Souls* is an expansive journey that takes listeners through soaring highs and somber lows. It’s packed with memorable moments: “Speed of Light” delivers a punchy single with a classic Maiden feel (and a fun retro video game-themed music video to boot), while “Tears of a Clown” pays touching tribute to comedian Robin Williams. But the album’s crowning achievement is “Empire of the Clouds,” an 18-minute epic penned by Bruce Dickinson that tells the tragic tale of the R101 airship disaster with piano, strings, and dramatic storytelling – arguably Maiden’s most elaborate song ever. Throughout the album, Bruce’s vocals shine (all the more remarkable given he was battling cancer during the recording), and the band sounds inspired. If there’s a downside, some critics felt the length made it a bit unwieldy to digest in one sitting. Nonetheless, the sheer quality of songwriting and the band’s fearless approach to pushing their sound make *The Book of Souls* one of the standout records of their later years. It lands in the middle of our list, which in Iron Maiden’s case means it’s still darn excellent. (Experience the epic scope of *The Book of Souls* on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+Book+of+Souls).)\n\n## 9. Senjutsu (2021)\n\nThe most recent studio album, *Senjutsu*, shows Iron Maiden aging like fine wine – with a dark, cinematic flavor. Released in 2021, *Senjutsu* (Japanese for “tactics” or “strategy”) finds the band building on the epic formula of their 2000s work. The album cover features Eddie as a samurai warlord, setting the stage for an album full of battle imagery and reflective mood. Musically, *Senjutsu* is bold and patient: songs like the title track “Senjutsu” and “Hell on Earth” are expansive and moody, while “The Writing on the Wall” brings a catchy, almost Southern-rock tinge to Maiden’s sound, and “Stratego” delivers a shorter burst of twin-guitar glory reminiscent of their classic days. At this point in their career, Iron Maiden isn’t chasing radio hits – instead, they’re crafting epic narratives set to music, and *Senjutsu* excelled at that, earning strong reviews and high chart positions worldwide. Some fans rank it among the band’s best work since the ’80s, whereas others feel it doesn’t quite match the nostalgia of the classics (it’s always tough for new material to compete with decades of legend). In our ranking, *Senjutsu* earns a spot in the upper-mid tier, a testament to Maiden’s continued vitality. After all, not many bands 40+ years in can drop an album of this scope and have it stand proudly alongside their legacy. (You can check out *Senjutsu* on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+Senjutsu&linkCode=ll2&tag=metalmantra-20&linkId=cb626a90abc1df0ce5c94556db3c4393&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) to hear Maiden’s latest chapter.)\n\n## 8. Killers (1981)\n\nThe early Iron Maiden albums have a charm and ferocity all their own, and *Killers*, the band’s sophomore release, remains a fan favorite. This 1981 album was the second (and final) Maiden record with original vocalist Paul Di’Anno, and it marked the debut of guitarist Adrian Smith, solidifying the classic twin-guitar attack with Dave Murray. *Killers* took the raw energy of the debut and tightened it up, thanks in part to producer Martin Birch. The result? A New Wave of British Heavy Metal classic brimming with streetwise attitude and galloping riffs. Just listen to the opening instrumental “The Ides of March” leading into “Wrathchild” – it’s an adrenaline rush that announces a band on the rise. Other highlights include the sinister “Killers” title track, the melodic “Prodigal Son”, and fan-beloved deep cuts like “Purgatory.” Di’Anno’s gritty, punk-tinged vocals give these songs a different edge compared to the Bruce era, and many fans treasure that diversity in Maiden’s catalog. While *Killers* doesn’t have the arena anthems that later albums would deliver, it’s pure, hungry Iron Maiden with a legacy of its own. In our ranking, it sits comfortably in the upper half – a testament to its enduring appeal for those who love Maiden’s early years. (If *Killers* is missing from your library, you can find it on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+Killers) and hear the raw power of Maiden 1981.)\n\n## 7. Iron Maiden (1980)\n\nWhere it all began! Iron Maiden’s self-titled debut album from 1980 is more than just a historical artifact – it’s a raucous, rough-around-the-edges gem that launched one of metal’s greatest careers. *Iron Maiden* introduced the world to the band&#8217;s fast-and-furious musicianship and dark fantasy imagery (all embodied by their mascot Eddie glaring from the cover). With tracks like “Prowler,” “Sanctuary,” “Running Free,” and the proggy mini-epic “Phantom of the Opera,” the album showed a young, hungry band fusing the raw power of punk with the technical prowess of metal. Paul Di’Anno’s vocals brought a gritty, street-level vibe that perfectly matched the music’s intensity. Sure, the production is a bit unpolished compared to later albums (the band was unhappy with how the sound turned out, feeling it didn’t fully capture their live energy), but many fans argue that’s part of its charm. *Iron Maiden* made a significant impact in the UK, helping to spearhead the New Wave of British Heavy Metal movement. Decades on, songs from this record still feature in Maiden’s live shows, and the album remains a thrilling listen. Ranking it against the more refined Bruce-era classics is tough – how do you compare an apple to an orange that breathes fire? – but we’ve placed the debut at #7, reflecting both its importance and its raw listenability. (Revisit the album *Iron Maiden* on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+Iron+Maiden+1980) to feel the birth of the legend.)\n\n## 6. Brave New World (2000)\n\nA triumphant return. *Brave New World* wasn’t just another Iron Maiden album – it was a statement that the beast was back. Released in 2000, this record reintroduced Bruce Dickinson as lead vocalist and Adrian Smith on guitar, reuniting the classic six-man lineup (with Janick Gers staying on as a third guitarist). The impact was immediate and electric. *Brave New World* marries the classic Maiden gallop and melody with a fresh, modern production and a renewed sense of grandeur. The opener “The Wicker Man” is a fist-pumping anthem that announced Maiden’s new era in style (that chorus “Your time will come!” felt very fitting). “Blood Brothers” became an instant fan favorite with its heartfelt tribute vibe and sing-along chorus often dedicated to lost loved ones in concert. The album is rich with epics like “Dream of Mirrors,” “Ghost of the Navigator,” and the title track “Brave New World,” which showed the band embracing longer, atmospheric intros and elaborate arrangements that would define their 2000s output. Critically and commercially, the album was a success – proof that Maiden had plenty of fuel left in the tank. Many fans consider *Brave New World* the best Iron Maiden album outside of the 1980s, and it earns a well-deserved place in our top ten. In our ranking, it comes in strong at #6, reflecting its quality and importance in the Maiden legacy. (If you haven’t experienced *Brave New World* lately, grab it on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+Brave+New+World) – it’s a modern classic.)\n\n## 5. Piece of Mind (1983)\n\nBy 1983, Iron Maiden were firing on all cylinders, and *Piece of Mind* captured a band at the height of their &#8217;80s powers. This was the first album with drummer Nicko McBrain, who joined and immediately locked in perfectly with Steve Harris’s galloping bass lines. The result? One of heavy metal’s great albums. *Piece of Mind* is chock-full of classics. “The Trooper” alone cements the album’s legendary status – that twin guitar lead and galloping rhythm have come to symbolize Maiden at their gallant best (and it’s accompanied by Eddie waving a tattered Union Jack on stage to this day). “Flight of Icarus,” the album’s big single, gave Maiden their first taste of American radio play with its soaring chorus. Beyond the hits, nearly every track is beloved: “Revelations” showed off Bruce Dickinson’s songwriting and vocal drama, “Where Eagles Dare” opened the album with blitzkrieg intensity, and deep cuts like “Die With Your Boots On” and “Still Life” are fan favorites. There’s also the admittedly goofy “Quest for Fire,” often playfully mocked for its “dinosaurs and men” lyric – but hey, a little whimsy doesn’t hurt. Overall, *Piece of Mind* stands as an essential Maiden release that built upon the breakthrough of the previous album and further solidified the band’s global rise. In our ranking, it rounds out the top five. Up the irons! (You can find *Piece of Mind* on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+Piece+of+Mind) and experience one of the quintessential 1980s metal albums.)\n\n## 4. Somewhere in Time (1986)\n\nIn 1986, Iron Maiden took a bold step into the future – sonically and thematically – with *Somewhere in Time*. After the exhausting World Slavery Tour, the band embraced some new technology, incorporating guitar synths to broaden their sound. The result was a lush, futuristic album that still roars with classic Maiden energy. *Somewhere in Time* often feels like Maiden’s most “1980s” album (in a good way): it’s big, it’s a bit experimental, and it’s loaded with atmosphere. The hit “Wasted Years” remains one of Adrian Smith’s finest songwriting moments, a perfect blend of melancholy and hard rock with an iconic guitar riff and a reflective message about time and home. “Stranger in a Strange Land,” with its cool groove and sci-fi Western vibe, became another fan favorite. And for the deep-cut connoisseurs, songs like “Sea of Madness” and “Alexander the Great” offer rich rewards – the latter closing the album with an epic history lesson that fans still campaign to hear live. Although no singles from this album charted as high as previous efforts, *Somewhere in Time* was a commercial success and has grown in stature over the years. It represented Iron Maiden not resting on their laurels and successfully exploring new territory. Many fans hold it as one of their top albums, and in our ranking it claims the #4 spot, just below the absolute cream of the crop. (Relive the space-aged majesty of *Somewhere in Time* via [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+Somewhere+in+Time&linkCode=ll2&tag=metalmantra-20&linkId=8c50953e3030323cd6233de993d35397&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) – it&#8217;s a journey through time every metalhead should take.)\n\n## 3. Seventh Son of a Seventh Son (1988)\n\nConcept album, anyone? *Seventh Son of a Seventh Son* saw Iron Maiden fully embrace a progressive rock ethos while still delivering all the metal fireworks fans craved. Released in 1988, this was the seventh studio album (aptly), and it built a loose concept around prophecy and mysticism, inspired by folklore about the “seventh son” having supernatural powers. Musically, *Seventh Son* is grand and cohesive. The band reintroduced keyboards/synth (this time via guitar synth and keys) even more than on *Somewhere in Time*, adding rich layers to their sound. The result is an album many consider the pinnacle of Maiden’s creative ambition. Take “The Evil That Men Do,” “Infinite Dreams,” or “The Clairvoyant” – each combines infectious hooks with intricate musicianship and lyrical depth. “Can I Play with Madness” gave Maiden one of their biggest hit singles, a surprisingly catchy and concise song amid the epics. And the title track “Seventh Son of a Seventh Son” is a tour de force: over 9 minutes of theatrical, progressive metal that ebbs and flows brilliantly (complete with a haunting choral section mid-song). The album’s consistency is remarkable; there’s no filler here, just one thematic piece after another. *Seventh Son* was also the last Maiden album of the 80s and marked the end of an era – after its tour, Adrian Smith left for a time and the band’s sound shifted in the 90s. Critically and popularly, this record often ranks near the very top, and we’re no exception: it claims the #3 spot on our list. Simply put, *Seventh Son of a Seventh Son* is Iron Maiden at their most epic and magisterial. (If you haven&#8217;t immersed yourself in this classic recently, find *Seventh Son of a Seventh Son* on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+Seventh+Son+of+a+Seventh+Son&linkCode=ll2&tag=metalmantra-20&linkId=04c8e276ffe3ed8ca0d1e19b48fa3032&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) and enjoy one of heavy metal’s finest hours.)\n\n## 2. Powerslave (1984)\n\nFrom the moment you see *Powerslave*’s cover – the imposing Egyptian-themed Eddie temple – you know you’re about to witness something monumental. And indeed, Iron Maiden’s 1984 masterpiece *Powerslave* is often heralded as one of the greatest heavy metal albums of all time. This is Iron Maiden at the height of their might. The album explodes out of the gate with “Aces High,” a ferocious opener about WWII fighter pilots that became a permanent live staple (often used to kick off concerts with an air raid siren wail). Right on its heels is “2 Minutes to Midnight,” a hard-rocking, politically charged anthem that gave the band a hit single and another concert favorite. The deep cuts on *Powerslave* are just as impressive – the eerie instrumental “Losfer Words (Big ‘Orra)” showcases Maiden’s musical tightness, while “Flash of the Blade” and “The Duellists” offer up galloping riffage and adventurous solos that lesser bands could only dream of writing. The title track “Powerslave” is a thunderous epic that finds Bruce Dickinson belting out mystic lyrics as if casting a spell, all culminating in the album’s grand finale: “Rime of the Ancient Mariner.” Clocking around 13 and a half minutes, “Rime” adapts Samuel Coleridge’s famous poem into a multi-part metal odyssey – it was the longest Maiden song for decades and remains a benchmark for prog-leaning metal composition. Beyond the songs themselves, *Powerslave* is significant for the mammoth World Slavery Tour that followed, where Iron Maiden toured the globe with their most elaborate stage show yet (captured on the legendary *Live After Death* album). Many fans and critics point to this era as Maiden’s peak, and it’s easy to hear why. *Powerslave* takes the #2 position on our list, narrowly missing the top spot only because that spot belongs to an album of truly beastly stature&#8230; (If somehow you don’t own *Powerslave*, do yourself a favor and grab it on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+Powerslave&linkCode=ll2&tag=metalmantra-20&linkId=19ee4583430eb6612831974e38438255&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) – this is essential metal history.)\n\n## 1. The Number of the Beast (1982)\n\nHere it is – *The Number of the Beast*, the album that transformed Iron Maiden from rising stars into heavy metal legends. This 1982 release was a turning point: it introduced Bruce Dickinson as the new lead vocalist, unveiled some of the band’s most iconic songs, and courted controversy that only boosted its fame. Simply put, *The Number of the Beast* is a cornerstone of metal. The tracklist reads like a greatest hits package: “Run to the Hills” with its galloping rhythm and soaring vocals became Iron Maiden’s breakout hit and a music video staple on early MTV. The title track “The Number of the Beast” is a dark, theatrical anthem (complete with a spoken word intro from the Book of Revelation) that had conservative groups in the ’80s branding Maiden as “satanic” – which, of course, only intrigued kids to crank it louder. And then there’s “Hallowed Be Thy Name,” the album’s closing epic, often cited as one of the best heavy metal songs ever written (it’s certainly a crown jewel in Maiden’s catalog, with its dramatic narrative of a condemned man’s last moments and an unforgettable guitar harmony section). But that’s just the big three; the album has no filler, from “Invaders” to “Children of the Damned” to “22 Acacia Avenue.” The energy, creativity, and confidence bursting out of *The Number of the Beast* are palpable, and it drove the band to new heights – it was their first album to hit #1 in the UK and put them on the map worldwide. Over 40 years later, it remains the yardstick against which Iron Maiden albums (and indeed many metal albums) are measured. For all these reasons, **The Number of the Beast** claims the #1 spot as Iron Maiden’s ultimate album in our ranking. Up the irons, and long live the Beast! (Celebrate this classic by revisiting *The Number of the Beast* via [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+Number+of+the+Beast&linkCode=ll2&tag=metalmantra-20&linkId=4e8c111fbbe4891bf3c996af5825cae1&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) – it’s mandatory listening for any metalhead.)\n\n**Final Thoughts:** Iron Maiden’s discography is the stuff of legend. Few bands can boast such a consistent run of influential albums or inspire such passionate debate among fans about “which album is best.” Whether you favor the raw grit of the Di’Anno years, the epic grandeur of the ’80s Dickinson era, or the dark and adventurous journeys of the modern albums, there’s no doubt every Maiden record has its own magic. This ranking is one fan’s take on a nearly flawless catalog – even the lower-ranked albums have moments of greatness, and the top-tier records helped define heavy metal itself. \n\nAs Iron Maiden continues to tour and possibly record new material, their legacy only grows. So cue up your favorite Maiden album (or discover a new one), and let the music take you on a flight through Icarus’s skies, over battlefields and ancient mariner’s seas, to worlds beyond. And remember, [Iron Maiden](/iron-maiden) will always *rock in peace*. \\m/\n\nRelated: [New Metal & Hard Rock Albums — January 9, 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/new-metal-hard-rock-albums-january-9-2026/) | [Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/)\n\nMore Metal Mantra: [Rundowns](https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/) | [Metal Tours](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/)\n",

    "title": "Welcome to Rockville: North America’s Ultimate Rock &#038; Metal Festival",
    "content": "\n**Welcome to Rockville 2026 stands tall as one of the largest and most electrifying rock and metal festivals on the continent.** Every May, tens of thousands of headbangers, riff-chasers, and devoted heavy-music faithful descend on Daytona Beach, Florida for four days of ear-splitting anthems, career-defining performances, and a culture-heavy festival experience that few events in North America can rival. As part of the modern U.S. festival circuit, Rockville has become a cornerstone event alongside other major gatherings covered in our [Festivals archive](/category/news/festivals). More metal news: [News hub](https://metal-mantra.com/news/).\n\nFrom its early days as a one-day rock showcase in 2011, Welcome to Rockville has evolved into a full-scale pilgrimage for fans of everything loud, heavy, and uncompromising. Hosted at the iconic [Daytona International Speedway](https://www.daytonainternationalspeedway.com/) — a venue better known for roaring engines than roaring amplifiers — the festival has carved out a unique identity as the annual centerpiece of the spring rock calendar. Whether you’re chasing circle pits, discovering emerging acts, or watching legacy bands reaffirm their dominance, Rockville delivers an immersive metal ecosystem that resonates long after the final encore fades.\n\n## Festival Identity — A True Metal Community Experience\n\nWelcome to Rockville isn’t just another large-scale music festival — it’s a cultural gathering point for the modern rock and metal community. Spread across multiple massive stages over four days, Rockville consistently blends mainstream headliners with underground champions and genre-pushing artists, creating lineups that speak to both lifelong metalheads and newer fans still finding their way into heavy music. That balance has helped Rockville maintain relevance across shifting trends while reinforcing its place in the broader [metal news](/category/news/metal-news/) landscape.\n\nFrom bone-rattling death metal and precision-driven thrash to anthem-ready hard rock, punk-infused hardcore, and metalcore’s most punishing breakdowns, Rockville’s booking philosophy honors the full spectrum of heavy music. This diversity ensures that every attendee — regardless of subgenre allegiance — finds their tribe somewhere between the barricade and the beer lines, surrounded by a sea of leather, studs, battle vests, and raised horns.\n\n## Why Daytona Beach? The Destination Festival Factor\n\nDaytona Beach provides more than a scenic backdrop — it’s an integral part of Rockville’s DNA. Each year, the Speedway’s sprawling infield transforms into a temporary city of sound, packed with towering stages, vendor corridors, immersive brand activations, and merchandise booths representing nearly every corner of the heavy-music underground. Beyond the gates, the Florida coast adds a destination-level appeal that elevates Rockville beyond a standard festival weekend.\n\nWhether fans are camping inside the Speedway grounds, booking beachfront hotels, or exploring the surrounding nightlife and food scene, Rockville encourages a festival-vacation hybrid that stretches well beyond set times. The result is a shared, multi-day experience where music, location, and community merge into something far more lasting than a single show.\n\n## Massive Lineups That Define Eras\n\nThe true backbone of Welcome to Rockville has always been its lineups — and the 2026 edition raises that standard once again. Celebrating its 15th anniversary, Rockville 2026 will feature more than 160 bands across five stages, with each day anchored by era-defining headliners and a deep undercard stacked with fan-favorite heavy acts. Few festivals manage to balance nostalgia and forward momentum as effectively as Rockville, a trait that keeps it central to annual touring conversations.\n\nThe 2026 lineup brings marquee performances from Guns N’ Roses, Foo Fighters, My Chemical Romance, and Bring Me The Horizon, supported by a formidable roster that includes Five Finger Death Punch, Parkway Drive, Motionless in White, Lamb of God, Turnstile, Rise Against, and dozens more. This blend of legacy icons and modern torchbearers turns Rockville into a proving ground where reputations are reinforced and new chapters are written in real time. Full lineup details are available via the festival’s official home at [welcometorockville.com](https://welcometorockville.com/).\n\n## More Than Music — The Rockville Lifestyle\n\nWhile the music remains the main event, Welcome to Rockville extends far beyond the stages themselves. Attendees can explore large-scale amusement rides, cool off on water attractions, discover immersive art installations, and take part in curated food and drink experiences designed specifically for a rock-centric crowd. These added layers help transform Rockville into a fully realized environment rather than a simple sequence of performances.\n\nCamping options, VIP tiers, and premium hotel packages allow fans to tailor their experience, whether they prefer front-row chaos or a more curated festival pace. That flexibility has made Rockville accessible to first-time festivalgoers while still rewarding long-time veterans who return year after year.\n\n## The Rockville Effect on Touring and Momentum\n\nWithin the broader rock and metal touring ecosystem, a slot at Welcome to Rockville carries real weight. Bands featured on the lineup often experience noticeable momentum shifts, with festival exposure translating into larger tour turnouts and increased visibility across the heavy-music media landscape. For newer acts, Rockville can function as a breakout moment; for established names, it serves as a powerful reaffirmation of live relevance.\n\nAs a result, Rockville continues to operate as a crossroads where legacy acts and modern contenders intersect, reinforcing the genre’s continuity while pushing it forward. That role makes the festival a reliable barometer for where heavy music stands — and where it’s headed next.\n\n## Why Welcome to Rockville Still Matters\n\nIn an era where large festival lineups can sometimes feel interchangeable, Welcome to Rockville distinguishes itself by embracing scale without sacrificing identity. Its coastal setting, genre-spanning bookings, and unwavering commitment to heavy music culture make it more than just another stop on the calendar — it’s an essential rite of passage for rock and metal fans across North America.\n\nIf you live for breakdowns, fist-pumping choruses, and memories forged in the fire of live amplification, Welcome to Rockville isn’t optional. It’s where the spirit of heavy music comes alive every May — loud, communal, and unapologetically heavy.\n\n**Tickets:** [Get Welcome to Rockville tickets on Ticketmaster](https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3DWelcome%20to%20Rockville)\n\n**More Metal Mantra:** [SLAYER To Celebrate 40 Years Of Reign In Blood At Rocklahoma 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/slayer-to-celebrate-40-years-of-reign-in-blood-at-rocklahoma-2026/) | [Louder Than Life 2026 Lineup Announced: Iron Maiden, TOOL, Pantera, MCR &#038; Nearly 200 Bands](https://metal-mantra.com/louder-than-life-2026-lineup-announced-iron-maiden-tool-pantera-mcr-nearly-200-bands/) | [ShipRocked 2027: Jan. 24–30 Cruise Announced After Sold-Out 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/shiprocked-2027-jan-24-30-cruise-announced-after-sold-out-2026/)\n",

    "title": "Review: Left For Good &#8211; Bad Omens",
    "content": "\nReview: *“Left For Good”* by Bad Omens More reviews: [Review hub](https://metal-mantra.com/review/).\n\n## Introduction: A Dark Return\n\nOn November 18, 2025, Bad Omens dropped their newest single ***“Left For Good”*** via Sumerian Records, marking the band’s fourth release of the year.\n\nThe song arrives amid high anticipation: frontman Noah Sebastian and the group have hinted at an upcoming album, and “Left For Good” feels like a bold statement — a song that sets the tone for the next phase of their evolution.\n## Sound and Production: Atmospheric, Industrial, Emotional\n\n“Left For Good” is arguably one of Bad Omens’ most atmospheric and emotionally charged tracks to date. The production leans into dark, industrial-tinged electronics layered over metallic, heavy undertones — a combination that feels both cinematic and intensely personal. It opens with a haunting, pulse-like electronic beat that builds tension slowly, drawing the listener into a brooding soundscape before erupting into cathartic breakdowns.\n\nInstrumentally, there’s a beautiful tension throughout: melancholic melodies meld with gritty guitars, bass and drums underpin a sense of unrest and emotional urgency. Karlsson’s guitar work, Ruffilo’s bass, and Folio’s drumming create a backdrop that seethes with shadowy energy, as the synth layers seep through like ghosts. Over that foundation, Noah Sebastian’s vocal performance glides from ghostly, angelic falsetto to tortured screams — a dynamic journey that mirrors the song’s emotional depth, giving the track a visceral, cinematic quality.\n## Lyrics & Themes: Inner Turmoil and Breaking Free\n\nLyrically, “Left For Good” delves into identity, regret, self-discovery, and the heavy decision to walk away from what no longer serves you. The song paints a vivid picture of internal conflict — a narrator torn between familiarity and the painful necessity to change.\n\nThe chorus — *“Why do I stay in the middle? Why do I say just a little? Why do I reach from the other side / For all I’ve left for good?”* — captures the tension of being stuck in limbo, unable to fully commit to change even though you know it’s right. Throughout the verses and bridge, the narrator confronts the “mire of truth,” “folly of youth,” and “smoke in the room” — metaphors that evoke disorientation, disillusionment, and the toxicity of past mistakes or relationships.\n\nYet there is a turning point: as the song reaches its climax, it becomes not just about despair, but about catharsis and autonomy. The raw honesty and demand for closure — “you owe me an apology” — shifts the narrative from pain to empowerment, as the narrator finally chooses to leave “for good.”\n## Emotional Impact & Significance\n\nFor long-time fans of Bad Omens, “Left For Good” demonstrates that the band is pushing themselves beyond past limitations — musically and thematically. The track doesn’t just lean on heavy riffs or conventional structure; it crafts a moody, immersive experience where atmosphere, emotion, and storytelling are given equal weight.\n\nAs many critics and early listeners note, this isn’t a mere addition to their catalog — it feels like an emotional anchor for the new era the band is entering. The raw honesty and the willingness to explore pain and growth make the song deeply relatable — for anyone who’s felt trapped by the past, stuck in indecision, or confronted with the difficult choice to let go.\n## Where “Left For Good” Stands in Bad Omens’ Evolution\n\n“Left For Good” follows a string of bold 2025 releases from Bad Omens — including songs that helped them climb charts and expand their sound. But compared to previous singles, this track feels especially intimate, emotionally raw, and sonically ambitious. It signals that the band isn’t content with repeating formulas — they aim to challenge themselves and the listener.\n\nAs frontman Noah Sebastian and the group gear up for their next album, “Left For Good” likely represents the emotional heart of that forthcoming work — a testament to growth, struggle, and rebirth. For many, it will stand out as one of their most powerful and resonant songs.\n## Conclusion\n\nIn “Left For Good,” Bad Omens deliver a haunting, cinematic, and emotionally devastating single that marries aggressive instrumentation with deep lyrical honesty. It’s a song about confronting inner demons, acknowledging pain, and choosing self-respect over comfort.

    "content": "\nAs discussions surrounding Wayne Static’s legacy continue to surface within the industrial metal community, representatives of the Static-X estate have confirmed that an **official, estate-approved documentary** is currently in development. Titled *Evil Disco – The Rise, Fall, And Regeneration of Static-X*, the film is positioned as the definitive account of the band’s history and the life of its iconic frontman. More metal news: [News hub](https://metal-mantra.com/news/).\n\nThe confirmation comes amid renewed interest in Wayne Static’s influence on modern metal and ongoing conversations about how his story should be told. According to the estate, the documentary is in post-production and has been developed with full authorization and cooperation from those closest to Wayne, ensuring that his life and career are presented with accuracy, respect, and proper context.\n\n## Evil Disco Aims to Tell the Full Static-X Story\n\n*Evil Disco – The Rise, Fall, And Regeneration of Static-X* is intended to chronicle the complete arc of the band’s journey, beginning with the formation of Static-X in the mid-1990s and their breakthrough during the late 1990s industrial metal boom. The film will explore how Wayne Static’s vision helped shape the band’s signature sound, blending aggressive guitar work, electronic elements, and dance-influenced rhythms into what Wayne famously described as [“evil disco.”](https://static-x.org/blogs/news/evil-disco-the-rise-fall-and-regeneration-of-static-x)\n\nThe documentary is expected to revisit key moments in Static-X’s rise, including the release of *Wisconsin Death Trip*, which became a landmark album in the genre and introduced the band to a global audience. Through archival footage and firsthand accounts, the film will examine how Static-X carved out a unique identity during an era dominated by nu-metal and industrial crossover acts.\n\n## A Focus on Legacy, Conflict, and Creativity\n\nBeyond commercial success, the estate has indicated that the documentary will address the internal conflicts and personal struggles that shaped Wayne Static’s career. These aspects are seen as essential to understanding both the band’s evolution and Wayne’s creative drive, offering viewers a deeper look at the pressures and challenges faced behind the scenes.\n\nThe film will also examine the band’s eventual dissolution in the early 2010s, the circumstances surrounding Wayne Static’s passing in 2014, and the profound impact his death had on the metal community. Rather than sensationalizing these events, the estate has emphasized that the documentary seeks to present them as part of a broader narrative focused on artistic legacy and human experience.\n\n## Regeneration and the Band’s Modern Era\n\nA significant portion of the documentary will reportedly focus on Static-X’s rebirth following Wayne Static’s death. The band’s reformation and subsequent releases under the *Project Regeneration* banner marked a new chapter, allowing fans to hear previously recorded vocal material from Wayne while honoring his influence.\n\nThe estate-approved film is expected to explore how the remaining members approached this era with caution and respect, balancing the desire to continue performing with the responsibility of preserving Wayne’s legacy. This period has proven pivotal in reintroducing Static-X to a new generation of metal fans while reaffirming the band’s place in industrial metal history.\n\n## Why the Estate Views This as the Definitive Documentary\n\nAccording to the estate, *Evil Disco* represents the most complete and accurate portrayal of Wayne Static and Static-X to date. By combining archival materials, interviews with band members, and insights from those who knew Wayne personally, the documentary is designed to serve as an authoritative historical record.\n\nThe estate has stressed that maintaining control over how Wayne Static’s story is told is essential to protecting his legacy. As interest in documentaries about influential musicians continues to grow, the film is intended to stand as the official account, reflecting both Wayne’s artistic achievements and the complexities of his life.\n\n## Anticipation Builds Ahead of Release\n\nWhile a release date has not yet been publicly announced, anticipation surrounding the official Static-X documentary continues to build. Fans have followed updates closely as the band and estate gradually share information about the project’s progress.\n\nAs the industrial metal community reflects on Wayne Static’s enduring influence, *Evil Disco – The Rise, Fall, And Regeneration of Static-X* is expected to play a key role in preserving his story for years to come. Additional updates are expected as post-production continues and plans for the documentary’s release are finalized.\n\nRelated: [Static-X Estate Pushes Back Against Unauthorized Wayne Static Documentary](https://metal-mantra.com/static-x-pushes-back-on-wayne-static-documentary/)\n\nMore Metal Mantra: [Rundowns](https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/)\n\n**More from Metal Mantra:** [Sick New World 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/sick-new-world/)\n",

    "title": "Gorillaz &#038; Limp Bizkit Announced for Rock for People 2026",
    "content": "\n**HRADEC KRÁLOVÉ, Czech Republic —** Rock for People has unveiled another massive wave of artists for its 2026 edition, confirming two explosive new headliners: **Gorillaz** and **Limp Bizkit**. The announcement strengthens an already stacked lineup that includes **Iron Maiden**, **Bring Me The Horizon**, and more than 30 additional acts set to perform from **June 10–14, 2026** at **Park 360 in Hradec Králové**. We&#8217;ll keep updates rolling in our [Rock for People 2026 coverage](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/rock-for-people-2026/).\n\nThis marks the first **Gorillaz** show in the Czech Republic in nine years, and their long-awaited return will headline the festival’s opening day. The Grammy- and BRIT Award–winning virtual band, created by **Damon Albarn** and **Jamie Hewlett**, will arrive with tracks from their upcoming ninth album, *The Mountain*, due in March 2026, alongside timeless hits like **Feel Good Inc.**, **Clint Eastwood**, and **DARE**.\n\nOn Thursday, nu-metal icons **Limp Bizkit** take the stage as the day’s headliner, bringing decades of high-energy chaos led by frontman **Fred Durst** and the visually electrifying guitarist **Wes Borland**. The band, known for anthems like **Break Stuff** and **Behind Blue Eyes**, returns to Rock for People after 11 years.\n\nFestival founder Michal Thomes celebrated the momentum:\n\n“It’s great to see the lineup growing before our eyes. Having four headliners confirmed in mid-October is every organizer’s dream – and this is just the beginning.”\n\nRock for People 2026 is shaping up to be one of the festival’s most ambitious editions yet, extending once again to **five days** after a massively successful 30th anniversary year. With demand for tickets accelerating, organizers note the festival is nearing a sellout.\n\n## **Second Wave Additions Strengthen an Already Massive Rock for People Lineup**\n\nAlongside Gorillaz and Limp Bizkit, the new announcement brings more major names:\n\n**Nothing But Thieves**\n\n**Three Days Grace**\n\n**Babymetal**\n\n**Sofian Medjmedj**\n\nThese additions join previously revealed artists including **Papa Roach**, **Electric Callboy**, **The Pretty Reckless**, **Breaking Benjamin**, **Megadeth**, and more.\n\n### **Current Rock for People 2026 Lineup**\n\n**Headliners:**\n\nGorillaz (June 10)\n\nLimp Bizkit (June 11)\n\nBring Me The Horizon (June 12)\n\nIron Maiden (June 14)\n\n**Also Performing:**\n\nElectric Callboy, Papa Roach, Three Days Grace, Alter Bridge, Babymetal, Bilmuri, Breaking Benjamin, Megadeth, Nothing But Thieves, Social Distortion, The Pretty Reckless, Basement, Blood Incantation, Don Broco, Gatecreeper, Joey Valence & Brae, Lottery Winners, Magnolia Park, Malevolence, Mammoth, Melrose Avenue, PRESIDENT, Sofian Medjmedj, Static-X, The Royston Club, Thrown, Unpeople, vianova, Wohnout, Yonaka, Zero 9:36.\n\nWith over **200 artists** expected, more announcements—including one final headliner—are still to come.\n\n## Why Iron Maiden Anchors Rock for People 2026\n\nWith Gorillaz and Limp Bizkit adding chaos, color, and crossover appeal, it’s **Iron Maiden** who ultimately anchors Rock for People 2026 in heavy music history. When a festival places Maiden at the top of a lineup this diverse, it sends a clear message: this isn’t a nostalgia slot — it’s a standard being set.\n\nThat authority comes from **Iron Maiden’s legacy**. Decades of genre-defining albums, world tours, and uncompromising identity have turned their catalog into one of the most influential discographies in metal. Whether you’re there for nu-metal, alt-rock, metalcore, or extreme metal, Maiden’s presence reframes the entire weekend around scale, ambition, and longevity.\n\nFor a deeper look at how Iron Maiden built a discography capable of headlining global festivals nearly 50 years in, explore our full breakdown of [**Iron Maiden’s discography and legacy**](/iron-maiden-discography-legacy/), covering the albums, eras, and turning points that continue to shape lineups like Rock for People 2026.\n\n## **Tickets & Festival Info**\n\nLimited **one-day tickets** are currently on sale. All three-day festival passes are automatically extended to four days (June 10–13), with the option to add Iron Maiden’s special Sunday performance for **CZK 1,000** until October 31.\n\n**Five-day passes, VIP, Comfy+, and children’s tickets** are also available.\n\nFull details: **rockforpeople.cz/en/**\n\n## **About Gorillaz**\n\nGorillaz—composed of characters **2D, Murdoc, Russel,** and **Noodle**—have redefined the boundaries of music, visual art, and digital culture. Their multimedia world, global collaborations, and legendary live shows have earned them praise from The Guardian, The Observer, and Evening Standard. With eight albums, countless awards, and a newly announced ninth album on the way, they remain innovators at the highest level.\n\n## **About Limp Bizkit**\n\nFormed in Florida in 1994, Limp Bizkit dominated the late 90s and early 2000s with their chaotic fusion of metal, hip-hop, and alternative rock. With over **40 million albums sold**, multiple Grammy nominations, and a cult global fanbase, they continue to deliver fiercely energetic live shows. Their 2021 album *Still Sucks* reaffirmed why their legacy still matters.\n\n## **Rock for People Continues to Lead European Rock Festivals**\n\nOrganized by **Ameba Production**, Rock for People has become one of Europe’s top rock and metal festivals. The 30th edition set attendance records with **50,000 visitors**, headlined by **Linkin Park, Slipknot, Guns N’ Roses, Sex Pistols**, and **Avenged Sevenfold**.

    "content": "\n**Sonic Temple 2026 stands as one of the most important rock and metal festivals in the United States, anchoring the Midwest’s heavy music calendar each spring.** Held annually in Columbus, Ohio, the festival draws tens of thousands of fans from across the country, delivering massive lineups that blend hard rock, metal, metalcore, punk, and alternative acts into a tightly curated multi-day experience. More metal news: [News hub](https://metal-mantra.com/news/).\n\nOriginally launched as Rock on the Range in 2007, the event was rebranded as Sonic Temple Art & Music Festival in 2019, signaling a broader creative vision while retaining its heavy roots. Hosted at [Historic Crew Stadium](https://www.historiccrewstadium.com/), Sonic Temple has grown into a cornerstone of the national festival circuit, frequently referenced alongside other major events covered in our [Festivals archive](/category/news/festivals/).\n\n## A Festival Built on Legacy and Consistency\n\nSonic Temple’s strength lies in its consistency. Year after year, the festival delivers lineups that respect the genre’s legacy while remaining relevant to modern audiences. From era-defining headliners to rising heavy acts gaining national attention, Sonic Temple balances familiarity with discovery — a formula that has kept it culturally significant for nearly two decades.\n\nThat balance is especially important in the Midwest, where Sonic Temple functions as both a destination event and a homecoming for regional fans. The festival’s location makes it accessible to fans traveling from multiple states, reinforcing its role as a communal gathering point for the broader rock and metal community.\n\n## Columbus, Ohio — A Purpose-Built Festival Setting\n\nColumbus provides an ideal backdrop for Sonic Temple’s scale and ambition. Historic Crew Stadium offers expansive grounds, clear sightlines, and a layout designed to handle large crowds without sacrificing the live experience. The venue’s open design allows sound to travel cleanly across stages, giving performances the weight and impact they demand.\n\nBeyond the gates, Columbus’ food scene, nightlife, and walkable districts contribute to a festival weekend that feels immersive rather than isolated. Fans don’t just attend Sonic Temple — they inhabit it for several days, creating a rhythm that blends live music with city culture.\n\n## Lineups That Reflect the State of Heavy Music\n\nAs Sonic Temple 2026 approaches, the festival once again positions itself as a defining moment for Midwest heavy music. lineups consistently act as a snapshot of where heavy music stands at any given moment. Headliners often include legacy acts whose catalogs helped define rock radio and festival culture, while the undercard highlights bands actively shaping the genre’s future. That structure allows Sonic Temple to function as both a celebration of history and a forward-facing platform.\n\nArtists appearing at Sonic Temple frequently use the festival as a launch point for broader touring cycles, with performances signaling momentum shifts and renewed visibility. Full lineup announcements and ticket information can be found via the festival’s official site at [sonictemplefestival.com](https://sonictemplefestival.com/), while ongoing coverage and artist updates live within our [metal news](/category/news/metal-news/) section.\n\n## The Sonic Temple Experience Beyond the Stages\n\nLike its peers on the national circuit, Sonic Temple extends beyond music alone.

    "title": "Sick New World Festival Returns as a Major Anchor for Modern Metal",
    "content": "\n**Sick New World has solidified itself as one of the most dynamic and culturally resonant heavy music festivals in North America, uniting generations of heavy fans under a single banner of intensity, nostalgia, and relentless sound.** Emerging in 2023 from the storied Las Vegas Festival Grounds, the festival distinguished itself by showcasing broad swaths of heavy music — from nu metal and industrial to modern metalcore — in a way that feels both reverent and forward-looking. In 2026, Sick New World will continue its evolution with two separate one-day events: a spring return to Las Vegas on April 25 and a groundbreaking expansion to Fort Worth, Texas at the Texas Motor Speedway on October 24, marking the festival’s first multi-city footprint. More metal news: [News hub](https://metal-mantra.com/news/).\n\nWhat set Sick New World apart at its inception was its refusal to conform to rigid genre boundaries. Instead of presenting isolated subgenre blocks, the festival bookers assembled lineups that spanned the heavy music spectrum, inviting fans of legacy acts, alternative metal, industrial titans, and modern heavy innovators to collide in shared enthusiasm. That philosophy has given Sick New World a reputation as a cultural event rather than just another tour stop — an identity that aligns neatly with our coverage of genre-defining events in the Metal Mantra [Festivals archive](/category/news/festivals/).\n\nThe Las Vegas edition of Sick New World remains a flagship festival experience. The Las Vegas Festival Grounds, a space that has hosted some of the most talked-about rock and metal events in recent years, provides an expansive canvas for the festival’s vision. The city’s destination energy, travel accessibility, and late-night culture make the experience feel larger than a single lineup — it feels like a pilgrimage. On April 25, 2026, Las Vegas will once again break open with a stacked roster of influential performers that reflect the festival’s eclectic DNA.\n\nHowever, the story of Sick New World’s growth in 2026 is just as much about geography as it is about evolution. For the first time, the festival will take its ethos to the Lone Star State, setting up a one-day event at the Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth on October 24, 2026. This expansion is significant not just because it brings Sick New World into a new region, but because Texas has a deep and enduring connection to rock and metal culture that continues to shape touring and festival circuits across the U.S. The Texas edition promises a lineup befitting the state’s storied rock legacy, offering both legendary names and contemporary heavy favorites.\n\n## Twin Experiences, Shared Intensity\n\nWhat unites the Las Vegas and Texas Sick New World events is a shared commitment to high-impact programming. Rather than diluting the brand into sprawling multi-day formats, Sick New World has doubled down on delivering concentrated one-day experiences that throw a spotlight on heavy music’s emotional resonance and communal power. Each event feels like a festival condensed to its most potent elements: nonstop stages, monumental performances, and a crowd that understands the significance of experiencing heavy music live together.\n\nThis approach resonates strongly in a festival landscape where brevity and intensity can be just as memorable as multi-weekend affairs, especially when paired with headliners that bridge eras. The presence of System of a Down, among other seminal acts, serves as a connective tissue between old and new generations of fans — a thematic current that runs through the culture of heavy music and one that fans frequently explore within our [metal news](/category/news/metal-news/) coverage.\n\n## A Cultural Anchor in Modern Metal\n\nBy expanding into Texas while maintaining its Las Vegas roots, Sick New World has positioned itself not just as a festival but as a cultural anchor for modern heavy music. The festival’s trajectory mirrors the evolving demands of fans who crave both nostalgia and discovery, community and individuality. Whether it’s thousands gathering under the neon skies of Vegas or the wide open grounds of Fort Worth, the energy is unmistakably communal, cathartic, and loud — the very essence of the heavy experience.\n\nSick New World in 2026 is more than a return; it’s a reaffirmation of heavy music’s vitality in the live music ecosystem, and its dual-location strategy underscores that significance. For fans who live for breakdowns, blast beats, roaring riffs, and the shared electricity of peak festival experiences, Sick New World remains one of the most compelling events on the North American calendar.\n\n**Tickets:** [Get Sick New World tickets on Ticketmaster](https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3DSick%20New%20World)\n\n**More Metal Mantra:** [SLAYER To Celebrate 40 Years Of Reign In Blood At Rocklahoma 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/slayer-to-celebrate-40-years-of-reign-in-blood-at-rocklahoma-2026/) | [Louder Than Life 2026 Lineup Announced: Iron Maiden, TOOL, Pantera, MCR &#038; Nearly 200 Bands](https://metal-mantra.com/louder-than-life-2026-lineup-announced-iron-maiden-tool-pantera-mcr-nearly-200-bands/) | [ShipRocked 2027: Jan. 24–30 Cruise Announced After Sold-Out 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/shiprocked-2027-jan-24-30-cruise-announced-after-sold-out-2026/)\n",

    "title": "Sleep Token Conjures An Arcadian Ritual At Oakland Arena",
    "content": "\nOn October 10, 2025, [Sleep Token](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/sleep-token/) turned the Oakland Arena into a temple of atmospheric metal. From the moment the lights dimmed and the crowd’s roar subsided into anticipatory silence, it was clear this would not be an ordinary concert—it was a ritual. Fans donned Sleep Token masks and merch, arriving hours early, buzzing with reverence for the UK band’s first-ever arena headliner in the Bay Area. More reviews: [Review hub](https://metal-mantra.com/review/).\n\nThe evening began with a potent opening set by Australian alt-metal outfit Thornhill, whose crushing riffs and melodic choruses primed the audience and built the tension to a fever pitch. By the time Sleep Token’s symbol flickered on the screen and the headliners emerged, the atmosphere was electric. What unfolded next was a transcendent journey through lush soundscapes and crushing heaviness, delivered with the mysterious flair that has become the band’s hallmark.\n\n## Musical Performance & Setlist Highlights\n\nSleep Token’s setlist was an odyssey through the band’s catalog, heavily showcasing their latest album *Even in Arcadia*. The show opened with the haunting intro of “Look to Windward,” as frontman Vessel’s ethereal voice intoned “Will you listen?” into the dark. At the song’s seismic drop, a massive curtain fell, revealing the masked quartet perched within an elaborate multi-tiered stage set. From there, the band launched into fan favorites like “The Offering” and “Vore,” seamlessly shifting between delicate piano passages and downtuned guitar onslaughts.\n\nAnchored by the ferocious drumming of band member II, the musicianship was airtight. Complex polyrhythms and dynamic shifts in songs such as “Caramel” and “Thread the Needle” were executed live with near-album precision. “The Summoning” featured a blistering drum solo that drew raucous cheers under an onslaught of strobes, while nearly the entirety of *Even in Arcadia* was woven together with material from *Take Me Back to Eden* and earlier releases. By the time “Infinite Baths” closed the set, the arena had been completely spellbound.\n\n## Stage Production & Lighting Spectacle\n\nIf Sleep Token’s music is a journey, their stage production provided the immersive world it inhabits. The Oakland Arena stage became a massive Arcadian castle—rocky, grotto-like, and layered with towering archways. At its center, the band’s glowing rune symbol served as a waterfall backdrop, with real water cascading down and catching the light. As the opening curtain dropped, the audience was pulled directly into the *Even in Arcadia* mythos.\n\nLighting was a spectacle of its own. Lasers and spotlights painted the air in vivid colors synchronized to each song’s emotional arc. “Alkaline” cut the darkness with piercing blue beams, while “Damocles” transformed the arena into a field of stars as fans raised colored lights in unison. Fog, falling petals, and blinding strobes were all deployed with precision, never overpowering the music but amplifying its emotional weight.\n\n## Audience Energy & Interaction\n\nThe Oakland Arena crowd was as much a part of the ritual as the band itself. Nearly 20,000 worshippers fell into reverent silence during the show’s opening moments, only to erupt in waves of movement and sound as the set unfolded. Tender passages like “Rain” were met with communal swaying and hushed sing-alongs, while the breakdowns of “The Summoning” detonated the floor into synchronized chaos.\n\nDespite maintaining complete onstage silence, Vessel and the band communicated volumes through movement alone. Gestures, posture, and presence created an unspoken dialogue with the audience. Fans traded friendship bracelets, shared space, and moved as one—a reminder that Sleep Token’s following is not just a fanbase, but a bonded community. The *Sleep Token Oakland 2025* performance felt less like a concert and more like a collective ritual.\n\n## Venue Atmosphere & Acoustics\n\nOakland Arena can be unforgiving acoustically, yet Sleep Token’s production team delivered a mix that was both massive and immaculate. Bass lines rattled the floor during “Vore” and “Granite,” while Vessel’s vocals floated clearly above the chaos. The venue shifted effortlessly between cathedral-like silence and overwhelming sonic force, a testament to the band’s command of space and dynamics.\n\nFew arena shows manage to feel intimate without losing scale. Sleep Token achieved both, holding the audience in a shared moment that felt personal and monumental all at once.\n\n## Standout Moments\n\nThe most jaw-dropping moment came during “Provider,” when a saxophonist emerged without warning to perform the song’s sultry melodic line live—marking the first time Sleep Token incorporated saxophone into their set. The unexpected fusion of smooth jazz tones with crushing metal sent the crowd into disbelief.\n\nLater, “The Summoning” triggered a full-arena eruption as thousands moved in unison, while “Damocles” bathed the venue in orange and purple light through a coordinated fan effort. When “Infinite Baths” closed the night, Vessel held the final note beneath sweeping green lasers, followed by a moment of silence before thunderous applause broke the spell.\n\nIf you left Oakland Arena wanting more, you weren’t alone. Fans can bring a piece of the ritual home with official Sleep Token merchandise, including [Sleep Token band t-shirts](https://amzn.to/4skILuT) or the band’s music on [vinyl](https://amzn.to/4qdUzNt).

For metal fans and live music devotees, nights like this are rare and unforgettable, where sound, vision, and collective energy converge into something truly otherworldly.\n\n**More from Metal Mantra:** [Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/) | [Top 10 Metal Tracks of 2025](https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-metal-tracks-of-2025/)\n",

    "title": "Testament – Para Bellum (Album Review)",
    "content": "\nEven before the music starts, the hand-painted cover art of *Para Bellum* — depicting a serene angel constructed from missiles amid an apocalyptic backdrop — signals that Testament’s fourteenth studio album is not a nostalgia exercise. As Bay Area thrash veterans with over four decades behind them, [Testament](/tag/testament) carry a legacy most bands could only dream of, yet they sound as ferocious, focused, and genuinely hungry as they ever have. *Para Bellum* — Latin for “prepare for war” — reflects a band that has no interest in softening with age. Instead, Testament deliver an album that pushes modern thrash forward with sharpened aggression, calculated darkness, and a disciplined sense of purpose. The result is a record that stands tall within their modern era and feels essential rather than ceremonial. More reviews: [Review hub](https://metal-mantra.com/review/).\n\n## A Balanced Onslaught of Speed and Substance\n\nFrom the opening seconds of “For the Love of Pain,” *Para Bellum* explodes with immediate intent. New drummer Chris Dovas wastes no time announcing himself, attacking the kit with relentless precision and raw physicality. Replacing a figure as iconic as Gene Hoglan is no small task, but Dovas doesn’t attempt imitation — he injects youthful violence and urgency that propels Testament into heavier, more extreme territory. The track itself is a whirlwind of serrated riffing, muscular grooves, and subtle blackened textures that nod to Eric Peterson’s extreme metal instincts. It’s an invigorating opener that makes one thing clear: this band is not here to replay the hits.\n\nLead single “Infanticide A.I.” follows as a high-velocity juggernaut, pairing blistering thrash speed with a venomous critique of technological overreach. Chuck Billy sounds commanding and dangerous, shifting seamlessly between classic thrash bark, guttural snarls, and eerie vocal inflections that give the song real narrative weight. Guitarists Eric Peterson and Alex Skolnick are locked in, unleashing riffs that feel both brutal and purposeful. Skolnick’s soloing here is particularly striking — fluid, sharp, and perfectly integrated into the song’s momentum rather than existing as technical exhibition. When the mid-tempo menace of “Shadow People” emerges, its ominous groove and dark undercurrents reinforce the sense that *Para Bellum* is expanding Testament’s sound without ever abandoning its thrash foundation.\n\nDespite its aggression, *Para Bellum* avoids becoming a one-dimensional barrage. Midway through the record, Testament introduce greater melodic range and dynamic contrast without losing intensity. “Meant to Be” stands as the album’s boldest left turn — a seven-and-a-half-minute epic that layers orchestral elements, clean guitar passages, and crushing heaviness into a slow-burning emotional centerpiece. Rather than feeling forced or sentimental, the track comes across as mature and earned. Chuck Billy delivers one of his most nuanced performances here, while Skolnick’s soaring solo injects genuine feeling into the arrangement. It’s an ambitious moment that deepens the album and proves Testament are still willing to challenge themselves creatively.\n\nOnce that tension breaks, the band returns to full-throttle assault. “High Noon” injects a swaggering groove laced with playful menace, while “Witch Hunt” and “Nature of the Beast” channel classic heavy metal melody through a modern thrash lens. Deeper cuts like “Room 117” and “Havana Syndrome” showcase Testament’s continued ability to evolve within their framework — the former locking into a thick, hook-driven mid-tempo stomp, the latter weaving galloping rhythms and harmonized leads into a crushing attack. The closing title track, “Para Bellum,” serves as a fitting finale: expansive, punishing, and layered with atmosphere, technical precision, and pure intent.\n\n## Standout Tracks\n\n  **“Infanticide A.I.”** — A blistering, high-speed standout that captures Testament at their most vicious. Modern thrash riffing, scathing themes, and surgical musicianship collide in one of the band’s fiercest tracks to date.\n  **“Meant to Be”** — A daring, emotionally driven centerpiece that expands Testament’s sonic palette. Orchestration, atmosphere, and heavy dynamics combine into a track that feels monumental rather than indulgent.\n  **“Havana Syndrome”** — Galloping riffs and melodic twin-guitar leads give this song a classic-metal undercurrent while maintaining a relentless thrash backbone. It’s one of the album’s most memorable late-stage punches.\n\n## Performance and Production\n\nPerformance-wise, *Para Bellum* captures Testament operating at peak efficiency. Chuck Billy remains one of thrash metal’s most authoritative frontmen, delivering vocals that balance brutality with control. Eric Peterson’s rhythm guitar work is dense and deliberate, providing the album’s unshakable foundation, while Alex Skolnick’s leads cut through with precision and personality. Steve Di Giorgio’s bass lines add depth and movement beneath the guitar onslaught, and Chris Dovas proves himself a formidable new force behind the kit, injecting speed, violence, and momentum throughout.\n\nThe production is equally formidable. Mixed by Jens Bogren, the album sounds massive without sacrificing clarity. Every instrument occupies its space, allowing the record’s density to feel powerful rather than cluttered. The guitars hit with weight, the drums punch with authority, and the atmospheric elements are woven in seamlessly. *Para Bellum* sounds modern, sharp, and uncompromising — exactly how a Testament record should sound in 2025.\n\n## Legacy Secure – Testament’s War Cry\n\nAt a time when many veteran bands rely on legacy alone, Testament continue to raise the bar. *Para Bellum* proves that thrash metal’s old guard can still outpace, outthink, and outplay much of the genre’s younger wave. This is not a band coasting — it’s a band sharpening its edge. There are moments of risk and stylistic expansion, but nothing feels half-hearted or stale. If anything, those risks give the album its identity.\n\nUltimately, *Para Bellum* stands as one of Testament’s strongest modern releases — a focused, aggressive, and deeply confident record that reinforces their relevance rather than merely celebrating their past. Fourteen albums in, Testament still sound dangerous, still sound motivated, and still sound like leaders. *Para Bellum* is available now via Nuclear Blast Records — you can grab it on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FN8DKMQ3) — and it serves as a clear reminder that Testament have no intention of surrendering their throne.\n\n**Listen/Buy:** [Find on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Testament+++Para+Bellum+%28Album&#038;tag=metalmantra-20)\n\nRelated: [Thrash of the Titans USA Tour 2026: Testament, Overkill &#038; Destruction Unite for an Epic Thrash Metal Assault](https://metal-mantra.com/thrash-of-the-titans-usa-tour-2026/)\n\nMore Metal Mantra: [Rundowns](https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/) | [Metal Tours](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/)\n",

    "content": "\nAftershock 2025 — The Ruckus, The Roar, The Resurrection\n\n    The 13th annual Aftershock Festival detonated at Discovery Park in Sacramento from October 2–5, 2025 — and it didn’t just rise up. It exploded. Over four days, more than 164,000 fans descended from across the country and around the world to witness what many are already calling the biggest Aftershock yet. It wasn’t just a concert series — it was a four-day collision of chaos, sweat, nostalgia, and unfiltered musical violence.\n\n    What followed was four days of sonic brutality and four nights of cathartic release: a celebration of rock, punk, and metal, where nostalgia and rebellion locked arms. This is the Aftershock Festival 2025 review through Metal Mantra’s eyes — messy, loud, and absolutely alive.\n\n## Day One — Pop-Punk Shock & Metal’s Back Alleys\n\n    Thursday’s opening salvo leaned hard into pop-punk nostalgia while quietly loading the side stages with serious heaviness. The main-stage Aftershock 2025 lineup for Day One read like a warped early-2000s mixtape: **Blink-182** reigning as headliners, flanked by **Good Charlotte**, **All Time Low**, **Taking Back Sunday**, and **The All-American Rejects**. It was a full-frontal assault of hooks, harmonies, and heartbreak lyrics yelled back by thousands of fans who grew up on warped-tour summers and burned CD-Rs.\n\n    Blink-182’s headlining set felt like a time capsule smashed open and reassembled at maximum volume. Anthems like “All the Small Things,” “Feeling This,” and “What’s My Age Again?” hit with familiar impact, while newer material proved the band has more in the tank than just nostalgia. Between off-color jokes and crowd-wide singalongs, the headliners turned Discovery Park into a communal therapy session for aging punks and wide-eyed newcomers alike.\n\n    But this is Aftershock — pop-punk was only half the story. Dive off the main drag and the festival’s metal DNA was very much alive in the shadows. Side stages churned with heavier acts: **Carcass** ripped through surgical death-metal riffs; **Cattle Decapitation** delivered a suffocating wall of grind and death; **High on Fire** smoked the air with thick, doom-soaked guitar tone; and **Nails** detonated short, vicious bursts of hardcore violence. For fans tracking the heavier end of the Aftershock 2025 lineup, Day One was already a win.\n\n    Hardcore and crossover fans got theirs too. Bands like **Hatebreed** turned circles of mud into tidal-wave pits, barking along to breakdown-ready anthems and turning the festival grounds into a training ground for the rest of the weekend. It was the perfect balance: main-stage pop-punk melodies on one side, underground chaos on the other. The message was clear — Aftershock 2025 wasn’t just for one subgenre tribe. It was for all of them.\n\n    Rain rolled in early and turned the park into a sloppy battlefield, but nobody flinched. Ponchos, trash bags, soaked hoodies and smeared eyeliner became part of the uniform. Fans trudged through ankle-deep muck to make it to the barricade, to catch that next chorus, that next breakdown. The weather tried to drown Day One; the crowd simply roared back louder.\n\n## Day Two — Homecoming, Bay-Area Thrash & Metal Legacy\n\n    Friday dialed down the sugar and turned up the weight. If Day One was a grin, Day Two was a clenched jaw. At the center of it all were Sacramento’s own **Deftones**, turning Aftershock 2025 into a full-on hometown ritual. From the moment they hit the stage, the air changed — thick with anticipation, history, and the kind of love only a hometown crowd can radiate.\n\n    Deftones built a career-spanning set, gliding from the dreamlike haze of “Digital Bath” to the feral stomp of “My Own Summer (Shove It)” and the crushing weight of “Diamond Eyes.” When epic cuts washed over the crowd, you could feel thousands of voices rising in unison — a generation that grew older but never outgrew the band. This wasn’t just a headline set; it was a community exhale, a shared moment between a band and the city that raised them.\n\n    The rest of the Day Two Aftershock 2025 lineup kept things dynamic and dangerous. **A Perfect Circle** delivered sleek, surgical alt-rock on the main stage — an exercise in tension, melody, and restraint amid the festival chaos. **Turnstile** lit up the crowd with their hyperactive, groove-soaked hardcore, turning the pit into a trampoline of bodies and sweaty grins. **Knocked Loose** barreled through one of the most violent sets of the weekend, conjuring breakdowns that hit like steel-toed boots to the chest.\n\n    But Friday had more than just groove and hardcore — it dug deep into thrash and Bay Area metal roots too. Old-school fans got their fix with legendary Bay Area thrash icons like **Death Angel** and **Exodus** tearing up the undercard stages. Their presence added a gritty nod to the region’s metal legacy, reminding everyone that Aftershock isn’t just about flash — it’s about roots, thrash history, and heavy metal’s long memory.\n\n    Metal traditionalists and prog-heads got their fix too. **Lamb of God** unleashed a textbook lesson in groove-metal, all whiplash riffs and razor-sharp precision, while **Dream Theater** bent time, tempo, and minds with labyrinthine prog epics. In between, you could catch everything from sludgy post-metal to classic-thrash revival, as bands rotated through stages like a living museum of heavy music’s evolution.\n\n    By the time the lights went down on Day Two, one thing was obvious: Aftershock 2025 wasn’t coasting on big names alone. It was curating moods. Deftones may have been the emotional anchor — the headliners who turned the park into a cathedral — but every band that touched Friday’s stages helped write the next chapter of the festival’s legacy.\n\n## Day Three — Nu-Metal Bullets & Underground Fury\n\n    Saturday was built for chaos. If you came to Aftershock 2025 for nu-metal, this was your day to bleed. **Korn** took command of the main stage with a set that felt like a livewire plugged straight into 1999 and dragged screaming into the present. From the first lurching bassline of “Blind” to the twisted bounce of “Freak on a Leash,” the band delivered a reminder of why they’re still at the top of the nu-metal food chain.\n\n    Jonathan Davis stalked the stage like a man possessed, his vocals shifting from guttural growls to desperate wails, while the band’s downtuned crunch turned the lawn into a heaving ocean of bodies. Old-school fans got their nostalgia overload; newer converts got baptized by dust, sweat, and riff. For many, this was the high point of the entire Aftershock Festival 2025 — the moment where anticipation, nostalgia, and live energy collided at full speed.\n\n    Korn didn’t carry Saturday alone. **Gojira** shook the earth with their titanic, eco-apocalyptic groove metal, each riff landing like an artillery shell. **Chevelle** kept the alt-metal torch burning with tight, melodic heaviness. **Bad Omens** brought a modern, sleek, almost cinematic edge to the lineup, pulling in younger fans and proving that contemporary metalcore belongs on big festival stages.\n\n    Away from the marquee names, Saturday’s undercard was a gauntlet. Deathcore units roared through sub-harmonic breakdowns; blackened thrash outfits spat out high-speed venom; hardcore bands turned smaller pits into boiling cauldrons of stagedives and pile-ons. Fans bounced between stages chasing the next riff, the next scream, the next chance to throw themselves into the fray.\n\n    By the end of Day Three, everyone was running on fumes and adrenaline. Voices were shot, necks were wrecked, and shoes were barely hanging together, but nobody slowed down. If Aftershock 2025 had a single word to define Saturday, it was simple: **relentless**.\n\n## Day Four — Apocalypse, Mayhem & Triumphant Closure\n\n    Sunday arrived with that weird mix of exhaustion and “one more day” desperation — and Aftershock 2025 answered with one of its most adventurous headliners. **Bring Me The Horizon** closed out the festival with a set that felt like a hybrid of metalcore, arena rock, and dystopian rave. Lasers cut through the night, massive choruses crashed over the crowd, and thousands of voices chanted every hook like a cult hymn.\n\n    From older cuts to newer, genre-bending tracks, BMTH treated the Aftershock 2025 lineup like a playground. “Shadow Moses,” “Throne,” and other fan-favorites detonated across the park, while newer, more experimental material showcased the band’s evolution into one of modern heavy music’s most divisive — and undeniable — forces. It was theatrical, bombastic, and unapologetically over the top, the exact kind of spectacle a four-day festival closer should be.\n\n    The rest of Day Four kept the needle buried in the red. **Rob Zombie** rolled in with horror-metal theatrics, zombie-flick visuals and carnival-of-the-damned energy. **Marilyn Manson** surfaced with a bruised, grimy industrial stomp that felt like a ghost of shock rock’s past grinding against the present. **Mudvayne** brought mathy, groove-loaded chaos, while **Machine Head** carved through tightly wound thrash and groove-metal epics that had the diehards losing their minds one last time.\n\n    As Sunday night wore on, there was this sense of collective burnout and triumph. Fans slumped between sets, grabbing water and air, only to surge back to life when the next band launched into their opening riff. When Bring Me The Horizon’s final notes faded into the Sacramento night, it didn’t feel like the end. It felt like the closing chapter of a story you’ll be replaying in your head for months.\n\n## Mud, Mayhem & Metal Community\n\n    No festival is perfect, and Aftershock 2025 made zero attempts to hide its rough edges. Rain turned sections of Discovery Park into mud pits, lines snaked for food and merch, and every square foot of shade was contested territory. But that’s the deal — you don’t come to a four-day heavy music festival for comfort. You come to survive it.\n\n    Through the inconvenience and exhaustion, what stood out was the community. Kids in oversized band tees and noise-canceling headphones sat on parents’ shoulders, seeing their first screamers and shredders. Old-school lifers in battle vests compared patches with Gen-Z hardcore kids. Strangers pulled each other off the ground in the pit, shared water, shared set recommendations, shared earplugs and inside jokes.\n\n    The real heart of Aftershock Festival 2025 wasn’t just the lineup — it was that sense of “we’re in this together.” Muddy shoes, bruised ribs, sunburnt faces, blown-out voices — all badges of honor from four days spent chasing the next riff, the next song, the next moment where the outside world fell away and only the music remained.\n\n## Resurrection, Not Just Another Festival\n\n    Aftershock 2025 wasn’t just another festival. It was a resurrection — of nuked-out mosh pits, of pop-punk and nu-metal nostalgia, of metal tradition, of sweaty camaraderie, and that raw, unpretty love for loud guitars and primal screams. It felt familiar but never safe, brutal but strangely hopeful, chaotic but absolutely necessary.\n\n    If you found yourself drenched in sweat at the barricade, limping back to your car with ringing ears, or simply standing back and watching generations collide to the sound of distortion, you didn’t just attend Aftershock 2025. You endured it. You lived it. And a piece of it is going to live in you for a long time.\n\nMissed it? That’s on you. But there’s always next year. The whispers around [Aftershock 2026](https://aftershockfestival.com/) have already started, growing louder with every replay of this year’s memories. If 2025 proved anything, it’s this: Sacramento’s loudest weekend is nowhere near done with us — and we’re definitely not done with it. \n\n## Explore additional festival coverage in the [Reviews](https://metal-mantra.com/reviews/) section at Metal Mantra.\n\nRelated: [Louder Than Life 2026 Lineup Announced: Iron Maiden, TOOL, Pantera, MCR &#038; Nearly 200 Bands](https://metal-mantra.com/louder-than-life-2026-lineup-announced-iron-maiden-tool-pantera-mcr-nearly-200-bands/) | [Pack Your Bags, Aftershock — Camping Arrives at Cal Expo for 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/aftershock-2026-festival-camping-cal-expo/)\n\nMore Metal Mantra: [Metal Tours](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/) | [Rundowns](https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/)\n\n**Tickets:** [Get Aftershock 2026 tickets](https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Daftershock%20festival)\n",

    "title": "Rock for People 2026 Announces Massive Lineup Featuring Iron Maiden, Bring Me the Horizon, Papa Roach &#038; Electric Callboy",
    "content": "\n**HRADEC KRÁLOVÉ, Czech Republic —** Rock for People, one of Europe’s premier rock and metal festivals, has officially unveiled the first wave of its **Rock for People 2026 lineup**, and it is nothing short of monumental. Leading the announcement are two global heavyweights: **Iron Maiden** and **Bring Me The Horizon**, joined by a powerhouse roster including **Papa Roach**, **Electric Callboy**, **Megadeth**, **The Pretty Reckless**, and more.\n\nThe festival will expand once again, running **five full days from June 10–14, 2026**, at **Park 360 in Hradec Králové**, reaffirming its status as one of the most ambitious and influential rock festivals in Europe.\n\n## **Iron Maiden to Headline a Special Extra Day for Their 50th Anniversary**\n\nIn a historic moment for both the festival and metal fans worldwide, **Iron Maiden** will headline a **special added festival day on Sunday, June 14**, marking an exclusive celebration of the band’s **50 years on stage**.\n\nThis stop on their **Run For Your Lives World Tour (2023–2026)** will be among the **last opportunities to see Iron Maiden live before the band takes a break from touring in 2027**—a major draw for longtime fans.\n\nWith classics spanning decades, a stage production unlike anything else in heavy metal, and the legendary Eddie in full force, Iron Maiden’s appearance is being hailed as one of the most significant bookings in Rock for People history.\n\nFestival founder **Michal Thomes** expressed both pride and disbelief at securing them:\n\n“Rock for People 2026 will once again be marked by the fulfillment of some of my dreams, led by Iron Maiden, whose music has shaped several generations, including me.”\n\n## **Bring Me The Horizon Returns as a Generation-Defining Headliner**\n\nModern heavy music juggernauts **Bring Me The Horizon** will headline on **June 12**, bringing their genre-shattering mix of metalcore, electronics, pop, and alternative rock back to the RFP stage after their unforgettable performance in 2024.\n\nBMTH continue to dominate globally with:\n\n**A BRIT Award**\n**A Grammy nomination**\n**7.2 million albums sold**\nMajor festival appearances including **Download Festival, When We Were Young, Sick New World**, and **NEX FEST**\nCollaborations with **Ed Sheeran, Yungblud, Machine Gun Kelly, and Sigrid**\n\nTheir high-production, emotional, apocalyptic live shows have become a hallmark of modern rock festivals worldwide—and Rock for People is positioning them as the flagship act for younger audiences.\n\n## **Rock for People 2026 — More Heavy Music Than Ever**\n\nAlongside the first two headliners, organizers have dropped a massive batch of **22 additional artists**, confirming that **2026 will heavily spotlight rock, metal, and metalcore**.\n\n### **First Wave Lineup Highlights**\n\n**Iron Maiden (June 14)**\n**Bring Me The Horizon (June 12)**\n**Papa Roach**\n**Electric Callboy**\n**Megadeth**\n**Breaking Benjamin**\n**Alter Bridge**\n**The Pretty Reckless**\n**Social Distortion**\n**Static-X**\n**Malevolence**\n**Blood Incantation**\n**Bilmuri**\n**Don Broco**\n**Lottery Winners**\n**Wohnout (first Czech act announced)**\n**Yonaka**\n**Zero 9:36**\nAnd many more across the rock, metal, metalcore, punk, and alternative spectrum.\n\nOrganizers confirmed this is **only the beginning**, with hundreds of artists still to come.\n\n## Why Iron Maiden’s Legacy Matters at Rock for People 2026\n\nPlacing **Iron Maiden** at the top of Rock for People 2026 does more than celebrate an anniversary — it anchors the entire festival in heavy metal history. Very few bands can justify a standalone festival day nearly 50 years into their career, and even fewer can do it while still selling out arenas and stadiums worldwide.\n\nThat staying power is the result of **Iron Maiden’s legacy**: a discography that helped define the sound, scale, and ambition of heavy metal itself. From early NWOBHM classics to global stadium dominance, Maiden’s catalog continues to influence the generations of bands sharing the Rock for People stage in 2026.\n\nFor fans looking to understand how Iron Maiden built a career capable of headlining festivals across five decades, our in-depth breakdown of [**Iron Maiden’s discography and legacy**](/iron-maiden-discography-legacy/) explores the albums, eras, and turning points that made moments like this possible.\n\n## **Festival Expansion, Ticket Details, and Extra-Day Options**\n\nAfter a record-setting 30th anniversary edition in 2025—featuring **Linkin Park, Slipknot, Guns N’ Roses, Sex Pistols, and Avenged Sevenfold**—Rock for People is once again pushing boundaries by extending to **five days**.\n\nKey ticket info includes:\n\n**Full festival tickets** are automatically extended from 3 days to 4 (June 10–13).\n**Iron Maiden extra-day add-on** available for **CZK 1,000** until **October 31**.\n**5-day tickets** also available.\n**VIP, Comfy+, and children’s tickets (ages 0–9)** are automatically valid for all 5 days.\n**One-day tickets** will be available once sales reopen.\n\nTicket sales resume **September 25 at 10:00 a.m.** at [**rockforpeople.cz**](http://rockforpeople.cz).\n\n## **A Festival Built on Sustainability, Accessibility & Innovation**\n\nSince 1995, Rock for People has championed modern rock music while building a festival culture rooted in **sustainability, accessibility, and community**.\n\nPark 360 is moving toward **climate neutrality by 2030**, supported by:\n\n17-type recycling system\nDeposit-refund drinkware\nLow-waste operations\nFully wheelchair-accessible grounds\n\nThe festival also supports multi-generational inclusion—each year inviting more than **200 senior citizens** from the region to a special concert experience.\n\n## **Rock for People’s Influence on Europe’s Festival Scene**\n\nOrganized by **Ameba Production**, the team also behind **RFP Concerts**, the festival continues to set records:\n\n**50,000+ attendees in 2025**\nFirst festival in the Czech Republic to run **five consecutive days**\nPrevious headline shows by **Ed Sheeran** and **Bryan Adams** at Park 360\nAdditional programming including the **Kefír baby-punk festival** and **Prague Music Week**\n\nWith its genre-spanning approach, commitment to sustainability, and consistently elite lineups, Rock for People continues to establish itself as one of Europe’s must-attend **rock, metal, punk, and alternative music festivals**.\n\nRelated: [Rock for People Adds Knocked Loose, Saxon, Alexisonfire to Iron Maiden Day](https://metal-mantra.com/rock-for-people-2026-iron-maiden-knocked-loose/) | [Rock For People 2026 Names Halsey as Final Headliner](https://metal-mantra.com/rock-for-people-2026-halsey-final-headliner/) | [Gorillaz &#038; Limp Bizkit Announced for Rock for People 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/gorillaz-limp-bizkit-announced-for-rock-for-people-2026/)\n\nMore Metal Mantra: [Metal Tours](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/) | [Rundowns](https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/)\n\n**Tickets:** [Get Rock for People 2026 tickets](https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Drock%20for%20people%202026)\n\n**More from Metal Mantra:** [Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/) | [Iron Maiden Discography &#038; Legacy](https://metal-mantra.com/iron-maiden-discography-legacy/) | [Sick New World 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/sick-new-world/) | [Aftershock 2025](https://metal-mantra.com/aftershock-2025-review/)\n",

    "title": "Review: Vicious Rumors – The Devil’s Asylum",
    "content": "\n## Vicious Rumors – *The Devil’s Asylum*: No Apologies, No Soft Edges, No Exit\n\nThere’s a certain point in a long-running metal band’s career where the options narrow. You either lean into legacy and coast, or you dig in and remind people why your name mattered in the first place. With *The Devil’s Asylum*, Vicious Rumors very clearly chose the latter—and they did it without sanding down the edges.\n\nThis isn’t a “comeback” record. That word gets thrown around too easily, usually when bands reappear with polite, mid-tempo material meant to offend absolutely no one. *The Devil’s Asylum* is something else entirely. It’s confrontational, sharp, and deliberately old-school in its values without sounding like a museum piece. This is U.S. heavy metal written by people who lived it, survived it, and still believe in it.\n\nFor anyone who somehow missed the memo, [Vicious Rumors](/tag/vicious-rumors/) have been grinding since the early ’80s, cutting their teeth in the same Bay Area ecosystem that birthed thrash royalty—but always walking their own line between power metal precision and street-level aggression. Geoff Thorpe has been the constant through lineup changes, industry shifts, label collapses, and the long, slow erosion of attention spans. The fact that this band is still operating at this level isn’t nostalgia. It’s stubbornness. The good kind.\n\n*The Devil’s Asylum* has zero interest in chasing trends or smoothing things out for modern playlists. The riffs bite. The rhythms push forward instead of floating. Solos actually say something again. And most importantly, the album never apologizes for being metal—real metal, not genre tourism.\n\nTracks like “Abusement Park” don’t waste time pretending subtlety is the goal. It’s a warped, nightmare-fuel theme wrapped in machine-gun guitars and a chorus that sticks without going soft. That balance—melody without weakness—is where a lot of modern bands fall apart. Vicious Rumors don’t. They’ve been threading that needle for decades, and here it sounds instinctive.\n\nWhat really carries this record, though, is its pacing. There’s no bloated runtime. No obvious filler designed to pad streaming numbers. Each song earns its place, and when the album moves, it moves with purpose. You can tell this was written by musicians who still think in terms of albums, not just singles.\n\nIt’s also impossible to ignore the context surrounding this release. The band dealt with tour delays after Thorpe suffered a serious shoulder injury—exactly the kind of setback that quietly ends careers if the fire isn’t there anymore. Instead of retreating, Vicious Rumors doubled down. *The Devil’s Asylum* sounds like a response to that frustration: lean, pissed off, and focused. If there’s exhaustion in here, it’s weaponized.\n\nLet’s be blunt for a second: a lot of veteran metal bands are still around, but very few sound hungry. This one does. And if that makes some people uncomfortable, good. Metal was never supposed to feel safe or polite. This record understands that on a fundamental level.\n\nFrom a production standpoint, the album avoids the plastic sheen that plagues so many modern releases. It’s clear, but not sterile. Heavy, but not compressed into oblivion. You can hear the air move when the drums hit. You can feel the tension in the guitar tone. That matters.\n\nFor longtime fans, *The Devil’s Asylum* slots comfortably alongside the band’s strongest modern-era releases. For newer listeners—especially those who think U.S. power metal is all polished choruses and fantasy themes—this album might come as a surprise. It should. Vicious Rumors have always had more grit than they get credit for.\n\nYou can grab *The Devil’s Asylum* here:\n [Buy *The Devil’s Asylum* on Amazon](https://amzn.to/3YKsDoK)\n\nIn a scene that’s increasingly obsessed with optics and algorithms, Vicious Rumors are still betting on substance. That’s not fashionable. It’s not easy. And it definitely won’t win over everyone. But it’s honest—and honesty is the one thing metal can’t afford to lose.\n\n*The Devil’s Asylum* doesn’t ask for your attention. It takes it. If you’re still here for heavy metal that values conviction over convenience, this record deserves your time.\n\n**Recommended for fans of:** classic U.S. heavy metal, power metal with teeth, and bands that refuse to age quietly.\n\nMore album coverage like this lives in our [metal news](/tag/metal-news/) section and weekly [new metal releases](/tag/new-metal-releases/) rundowns—because the scene doesn’t stop just because the industry keeps changing.\n\n**Pick up *The Devil&#8217;s Asylum*:** [Get it on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Vicious+Rumors+Devils+Asylum+vinyl&#038;tag=metalmantra-20)\n\nRelated: [Metal &#038; Hard Rock News – February 18, 2026: Thrash Reloads, Tour Season Surges, and More Lineup Shakeups](https://metal-mantra.com/metal-hard-rock-news-february-18-2026/) | [Metal &#038; Hard Rock News – January 21, 2026: Megadeth’s Final Salvo, Lorna Shore Storms North America, and Thrash Legends Say Goodbye](https://metal-mantra.com/metal-news-january-2026-megadeth-lorna-shore-sepultura/)\n\nMore Metal Mantra: [Rundowns](https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/) | [Metal Tours](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/)\n\n**More from Metal Mantra:** [Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026](https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/)\n",

    "title": "Farewell to the Prince of Darkness: Ozzy Osbourne (1948–2025)",
    "content": "\nThis one hurts in a way that doesn’t fade after the first reread. Ozzy Osbourne is dead, and the world feels quieter, duller, less dangerous because of it. The Prince of Darkness passed away on July 22, 2025, at his home in Buckinghamshire, and even writing that sentence feels wrong, like history refusing to behave. Ozzy was never supposed to be mortal. He outlived excess, addiction, scandal, broken bones, broken systems, and a music industry that tried repeatedly to sand down what made him dangerous. He survived things that would have buried lesser men before the first chorus. And yet here we are, saying goodbye to the voice that gave metal its soul, its menace, and its misfit heart. For anyone who grew up with Black Sabbath rattling cheap speakers or Ozzy solo records blasting from rusted-out cars, this isn’t just the loss of a musician. It’s the loss of a constant. Ozzy was always there. And now he isn’t. That realization hits like a hammer to the chest.\n\nOzzy came from nothing. That matters. Birmingham steel-town nothing. A working-class kid with dyslexia, no safety net, no polish, and no future that made sense on paper. He didn’t climb a ladder. He clawed his way out of the gutter by sheer force of will and an unrepeatable voice. When Black Sabbath formed at the end of the ’60s, nobody involved knew they were inventing heavy metal. They just knew the world was ugly, loud, and violent, and the music should sound like that. Ozzy’s voice wasn’t pretty in the traditional sense, but it was haunting, desperate, and human. When he sang about war, madness, paranoia, and doom, it didn’t feel theatrical. It felt lived-in. Sabbath didn’t just create riffs; they created atmosphere. Fear. Weight. And Ozzy stood at the center of it, sounding like a siren calling lost kids home. Heavy metal didn’t exist before Black Sabbath, and it certainly didn’t exist without Ozzy Osbourne. That’s not mythology. That’s fact.\n\nBeing fired from Black Sabbath in 1979 should have been the end. It would’ve been for almost anyone else. Addiction had its claws in him, the industry had written him off, and the narrative was already forming: tragic pioneer burns out early. Ozzy refused that ending. What followed was one of the most unlikely second acts in music history. Blizzard of Ozz didn’t just prove he could survive without Sabbath; it proved he could thrive. Songs like “Crazy Train,” “Mr. Crowley,” and “Diary of a Madman” didn’t sound like nostalgia plays. They sounded hungry. Dangerous. Forward-moving. Ozzy didn’t retreat into legacy status. He built a solo career that rivaled and in some ways eclipsed his original band’s reach. He became the rare figure who mattered across multiple generations while still actively shaping the future of the genre.\n\nAnd yes, the madness mattered. The bat. The doves. The chaos. The stories that became folklore. Ozzy lived the kind of rock star excess most bands cosplay but never truly inhabit. But what separated him from caricature was honesty. There was never an attempt to pretend he had it all under control. He was open about his flaws, his addictions, his failures. He wore them on his sleeve. The moral panic crowd called him evil. Parents feared him. Politicians and preachers tried to turn him into a scapegoat. Ozzy absorbed all of it and turned it into fuel. He didn’t clean himself up to make others comfortable. He let the world scream while he laughed, staggered forward, and kept singing. That refusal to conform is a massive part of why metal culture exists the way it does today.\n\nThen something unexpected happened. Ozzy became human to the mainstream. The Osbournes didn’t soften him; it revealed him. The confused, swearing, big-hearted mess behind the eyeliner. Suddenly the Prince of Darkness was a baffled dad yelling at dogs and trying to understand remote controls. It could’ve destroyed his credibility. Instead, it deepened it. Metalheads already knew Ozzy wasn’t a cartoon villain. Now the rest of the world did too. He became something few metal icons ever achieve: universally beloved without ever betraying the scene that raised him. He never apologized for being metal. He just showed people who he really was.\n\nThe final years were hard to watch. Parkinson’s. Injuries. Pain that refused to let go. Ozzy never hid it, but he also never stopped wanting to perform. Touring became impossible, and that admission cut deep. Still, he gave everything he had left. The final show in Birmingham earlier this month wasn’t just a concert. It was a farewell ritual. A city paying tribute to its most famous son. Ozzy seated on a throne, visibly frail but unmistakably commanding, while tens of thousands of voices carried him through the songs that defined their lives. When “Mama, I’m Coming Home” hit, grown adults openly sobbed. When “Paranoid” closed the night, it felt like time folding in on itself. The beginning and the end sharing the same stage. Seventeen days later, he was gone. There’s something cruelly poetic about that.\n\nThe response to Ozzy’s death tells the real story. Metal bands. Rock bands. Pop artists. Entire scenes stopping to pay respect. Tributes pouring in from artists who never sounded anything like him but were still shaped by his refusal to play it safe. That’s the mark of a true pioneer. Ozzy didn’t just influence metal. He changed the rules of who was allowed to exist loudly, imperfectly, and unapologetically in music. Without him, the door doesn’t open for countless bands, festivals, careers, and lifetimes of noise. Without Ozzy, metal doesn’t become a culture. It becomes a footnote.\n\nHere’s the blunt truth: there will never be another Ozzy Osbourne. Not because the industry won’t try, but because the conditions that created him don’t exist anymore. You can’t manufacture that kind of authenticity. You can’t fake surviving your own mythology. Ozzy lived every lyric, every rumor, every headline, and somehow came out the other side still smiling, still grateful, still metal to his core. He wasn’t perfect. He was better than perfect. He was real. And that’s why this hurts so much.\n\nThe man is gone. The voice is silent. But the echo is eternal. Every doom riff. Every festival crowd. Every kid discovering Sabbath for the first time and realizing music can be dark, heavy, and honest all at once. That’s Ozzy. Always has been. Always will be. Rest easy, Prince of Darkness. The world is darker without you, but metal will make sure you’re never forgotten.\n\nRelated: [Metal &#038; Hard Rock News – December 5, 2025: New Songs, Farewell Events &#038; Touring Updates](https://metal-mantra.com/hard-rock-news-december-5-2025/)\n\nMore Metal Mantra: [Rundowns](https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/) | [Metal Tours](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/)\n",

    "title": "Metallica M72 Turns Levi’s Stadium Into Sacred Ground During No Repeat Weekend in Santa Clara",
    "content": "\nIn their Bay Area “hometown” stronghold of Santa Clara, [Metallica’s M72 World Tour](https://www.metallica.com/tour) presented a colossal “No Repeat Weekend” across “two epic nights” at Levi’s Stadium — a weekend that wasn’t just a concert, but a metal pilgrimage. Over June 20 and June 22, 2025, the four-decade juggernaut delivered performances that pushed the boundaries of what a stadium show can feel like, all while honoring their roots, catalog deep cuts, and the loyal, generational crowd that has sustained them for nearly 45 years.\n\n### Night 1 — Historic Opening, Vast Setlist & Raw Power\n\nThe first night of Metallica’s Santa Clara takeover was a ferocious declaration of intent. Before the headliners, the stage was warmed up by two very different acts that helped shape the heavy music landscape. First, Ice Nine Kills brought theatrical metalcore with slasher-film flair — a visually intense, horror-themed performance that grabbed attention and set an electrified tone for the evening. Their combination of narrative theatrics and melodic brutality woke the stadium early and teased just how varied this weekend would be.\n\nFollowing them, Limp Bizkit injected a jolt of late-90s nu-metal nostalgia. Fred Durst and Wes Borland commanded a crowd not normally aligned with their genre with unapologetic swagger, remixing rap rock swagger with crowd incitement. By the time Bizkit wrapped with high-energy classics, the stadium was livid with anticipation — not just for Metallica, but for a full weekend of diverse heavy music experiences.\n\nWhen [Metallica](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/metallica/) hit the stage, the Levi’s crowd responded like the roof had been blown off. From the first thunderous strikes of “Creeping Death,” the band unleashed a setlist that ranged from early thrash anthems to newer material. The band’s 360° central stage created a rare intimacy for a stadium production, allowing the group to connect with fans on all sides — and for fans to feel engulfed in the soundwaves of history.\n\nNight 1 was packed with classics like “Harvester of Sorrow,” “Hit the Lights,” and “Battery,” alongside newer tracks such as “72 Seasons” and “If Darkness Had a Son.” There was also a rare tribute moment during “Orion,” a fan favorite instrumental that paid homage to one of the band’s fallen heroes. From the atmospheric acoustics of “Nothing Else Matters” to the blistering group chants of “Seek & Destroy,” the vibe was electric and unrelenting.\n\nThe finale was nothing short of cinematic: a thunderous run into “Fuel,” big-room sing-alongs, and the iconic closing might of “Master of Puppets,” leaving a crowd exhausted, exhilarated, and already hungry for Night 2.\n\n### Night 2 — Deep Cuts, Bay Area Homage & Unforgettable Moments\n\nIf Night 1 was thunder, Night 2 was lightning. The opener lineup on the Sunday was a perfect complement, kicking off with veteran crossover thrashers Suicidal Tendencies. They brought fierce energy and raw Old School attitude, snarling their way through hardcore anthems and firing up pits that made it clear this would be no laid-back Sunday.\n\nThe featured support act was [Pantera](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/pantera/) — a groove metal icon returning in tribute form with members giving fierce renditions of classics and honoring the legacy of Dimebag Darrell and Vinnie Paul. Their performance turned into a moment of communal reverence and carnage, throwing a spotlight (and massive pits) on the deeper well of heavy music influence that shaped a generation.\n\nMetallica’s own setlist on Night 2 was a lesson in dynamics and scope. They hit hard out of the gate with thrash staples like “Whiplash” and “For Whom the Bell Tolls,” building into atmospheric mid-set highlights like “The Memory Remains.” Newer songs — including “Lux Æterna” and “Screaming Suicide” — blended effortlessly with classics, reflecting both the band’s evolution and continued relevance.\n\nA standout moment came from the playful “Kirk & Rob Doodle” where snippets of unexpected covers teased the crowd, paying homage to the region and punk roots alike — a cheeky Bay Area nod that became an instant conversation point. More heartfelt were the layered tributes scattered throughout the set: somber instrumental passages and renditions that honored legacy and lineage.\n\nNight 2 delivered emotional climaxes with the pummeling drama of “The Unforgiven,” the rollicking sing-along of “Whiskey in the Jar,” and pulse-pounding intensity from “Blackened” and “Moth Into Flame.” The penultimate moment — a towering performance of “One” — brought the house down before the final, festival-defining sing-through of “Enter Sandman,” which reverberated through the stadium like an anthem for a generation.\n\n### Highlights & Weekend Takeaways\n\nWhat made this “No Repeat Weekend” more than just two shows were the combination of [distinct setlists](https://www.setlist.fm/search?query=metallica+santa+clara), powerful opening acts, artistic range, and the palpable hometown pride. Across both nights, Metallica traversed the breadth of their career — from early thrash and cult deep cuts, through emotional balladry, to contemporary anthems — without repeating a single song between the evenings.\n\nThe production was immense yet considerate — the 360° stage design and immersive lighting kept every seat in the house feeling close to the action. Meanwhile, the crowd’s energy — tens of thousands of fans who queued hours early, sang every line, and revived the sense of community in live heavy music — made the whole experience unforgettable.\n\nFor the Bay Area, this wasn’t just a Metallica tour stop. It was a homecoming celebration, a historical marker, and a reminder that even after decades at the top of the metal world, Metallica can still deliver shows that feel vital, personal, and wildly euphoric.\n\n[72 Seasons on vinyl](https://amzn.to/4pOD06R)\n\nMore Metal Mantra: [News](https://metal-mantra.com/news/) | [Tours & Tickets](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/)\n",

    "content": "\n## Metallica M72 Turns Levi’s Stadium Into Sacred Ground During No Repeat Weekend in Santa Clara\n\nIn their Bay Area “hometown” stronghold of Santa Clara, [Metallica’s M72 World Tour](https://www.metallica.com/tour) presented a colossal &#8220;No Repeat Weekend&#8221; across &#8220;two epic nights&#8221; at Levi’s Stadium — a weekend that wasn’t just a concert, but a metal pilgrimage. Over June 20 and June 22, 2025, the four-decade juggernaut delivered performances that pushed the boundaries of what a stadium show can feel like, all while honoring their roots, catalog deep cuts, and the loyal, generational crowd that has sustained them for nearly 45 years.\n\n### Night 1 — Historic Opening, Vast Setlist & Raw Power\n\nThe first night of Metallica’s Santa Clara takeover was a ferocious declaration of intent. Before the headliners, the stage was warmed up by two very different acts that helped shape the heavy music landscape. First, Ice Nine Kills brought theatrical metalcore with slasher-film flair — a visually intense, horror-themed performance that grabbed attention and set an electrified tone for the evening. Their combination of narrative theatrics and melodic brutality woke the stadium early and teased just how varied this weekend would be.\n\nFollowing them, Limp Bizkit injected a jolt of late-90s nu-metal nostalgia. Fred Durst and Wes Borland commanded a crowd not normally aligned with their genre with unapologetic swagger, remixing rap rock swagger with crowd incitement. By the time Bizkit wrapped with high-energy classics, the stadium was livid with anticipation — not just for Metallica, but for a full weekend of diverse heavy music experiences.\n\nWhen [Metallica](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/metallica/) hit the stage, the Levi’s crowd responded like the roof had been blown off. From the first thunderous strikes of “Creeping Death,” the band unleashed a setlist that ranged from early thrash anthems to newer material. The band’s 360° central stage created a rare intimacy for a stadium production, allowing the group to connect with fans on all sides — and for fans to feel engulfed in the soundwaves of history.\n\nNight 1 was packed with classics like “Harvester of Sorrow,” “Hit the Lights,” and “Battery,” alongside newer tracks such as “72 Seasons” and “If Darkness Had a Son.” There was also a rare tribute moment during “Orion,” a fan favorite instrumental that paid homage to one of the band’s fallen heroes. From the atmospheric acoustics of “Nothing Else Matters” to the blistering group chants of “Seek & Destroy,” the vibe was electric and unrelenting.\n\nThe finale was nothing short of cinematic: a thunderous run into “Fuel,” big-room sing-alongs, and the iconic closing might of “Master of Puppets,” leaving a crowd exhausted, exhilarated, and already hungry for Night 2.\n\n### Night 2 — Deep Cuts, Bay Area Homage & Unforgettable Moments\n\nIf Night 1 was thunder, Night 2 was lightning. The opener lineup on the Sunday was a perfect complement, kicking off with veteran crossover thrashers Suicidal Tendencies. They brought fierce energy and raw Old School attitude, snarling their way through hardcore anthems and firing up pits that made it clear this would be no laid-back Sunday.\n\nThe featured support act was [Pantera](https://metal-mantra.com/tag/pantera/) — a groove metal icon returning in tribute form with members giving fierce renditions of classics and honoring the legacy of Dimebag Darrell and Vinnie Paul. Their performance turned into a moment of communal reverence and carnage, throwing a spotlight (and massive pits) on the deeper well of heavy music influence that shaped a generation.\n\nMetallica’s own setlist on Night 2 was a lesson in dynamics and scope. They hit hard out of the gate with thrash staples like “Whiplash” and “For Whom the Bell Tolls,” building into atmospheric mid-set highlights like “The Memory Remains.” Newer songs — including “Lux Æterna” and “Screaming Suicide” — blended effortlessly with classics, reflecting both the band’s evolution and continued relevance.\n\nA standout moment came from the playful “Kirk & Rob Doodle” where snippets of unexpected covers teased the crowd, paying homage to the region and punk roots alike — a cheeky Bay Area nod that became an instant conversation point. More heartfelt were the layered tributes scattered throughout the set: somber instrumental passages and renditions that honored legacy and lineage.\n\nNight 2 delivered emotional climaxes with the pummeling drama of “The Unforgiven,” the rollicking sing-along of “Whiskey in the Jar,” and pulse-pounding intensity from “Blackened” and “Moth Into Flame.” The penultimate moment — a towering performance of “One” — brought the house down before the final, festival-defining sing-through of “Enter Sandman,” which reverberated through the stadium like an anthem for a generation.\n\n### Highlights & Weekend Takeaways\n\nWhat made this “No Repeat Weekend” more than just two shows were the combination of [distinct setlists](https://www.setlist.fm/search?query=metallica+santa+clara), powerful opening acts, artistic range, and the palpable hometown pride. Across both nights, Metallica traversed the breadth of their career — from early thrash and cult deep cuts, through emotional balladry, to contemporary anthems — without repeating a single song between the evenings.\n\nThe production was immense yet considerate — the 360° stage design and immersive lighting kept every seat in the house feeling close to the action. Meanwhile, the crowd’s energy — tens of thousands of fans who queued hours early, sang every line, and revived the sense of community in live heavy music — made the whole experience unforgettable.\n\nFor the Bay Area, this wasn’t just a Metallica tour stop. It was a homecoming celebration, a historical marker, and a reminder that even after decades at the top of the metal world, Metallica can still deliver shows that feel vital, personal, and wildly euphoric.\n\n[72 Seasons on vinyl](https://amzn.to/4pOD06R)\n",

    "content": "\nShiprocked 2025 didn’t feel like a “vacation.” It felt like getting thrown into a floating metal city for a week and being dared to keep up. Sun on your face, salt in your eyes, bass in your chest, and a schedule that made “rest” sound like a made-up concept for civilians. This is the part people still don’t understand until they go: Shiprocked isn’t a cruise with concerts sprinkled in. It’s a full-blown festival that happens to be trapped on a ship… and that captivity is the ***magic***. You can’t “head out early.” You can’t “catch the next band tomorrow” without consequences. It’s all happening, everywhere, all the time. Blink and you miss something stupidly fun, brutally heavy, or both.\n\nThe best part is the vibe. Shiprocked doesn’t do the sterile, barricaded, influencer-polished nonsense that’s creeping into everything else. It’s sweat, bad decisions, and genuine connection — the kind of scene energy that feels like it used to in the old days, before everyone started worrying about optics. Bands aren’t sealed away behind velvet ropes. You see them in line. You see them laughing in the halls. You see them watching other bands like actual fans. That closeness turns the whole week into this weird, beautiful metal summer camp where the soundtrack is crushing and the community actually means something.\n\nParkway Drive ignite the ShipRocked main deck, turning the pool area into a full-scale metal battleground after dark.\n\nShiprocked 2025 also hit that sweet spot lineup-wise: heavy enough to satisfy the riff addicts, varied enough to keep the week from turning into one long same-sounding blur. The headliners brought the big-festival punch, but the real story is how the ship’s layout forces everyone into the same orbit. Main deck sets become massive communal explosions — sun-baked singalongs, pool-deck conga lines, people losing their minds in sunglasses like it’s the most normal thing on earth. Then you wander inside and suddenly you’re shoulder-to-shoulder in a smaller room watching a band tear the place apart at point-blank range. No giant field. No hiking a mile between stages. It’s immediate. It’s loud. It’s relentless.\n\nAnd the weeklong format changes how you experience it. On land, you’re sprinting: set, set, set, sleep, repeat. On Shiprocked you start to settle into the chaos. By day two, the ship becomes your ecosystem. By day three, you’ve got a “crew” whether you planned on it or not — the same faces at the rail, the same exhausted grin at breakfast, the same “what did we miss last night?” debates that turn into war stories. By day five, everyone looks a little haunted, a little feral, and completely happy about it. It’s a shared delirium. It bonds people fast.\n\nThen there are the port days — the surreal highlights that make Shiprocked feel like a metal hallucination you can’t explain to anyone who wasn’t there. Stepping off the ship into postcard-perfect scenery and immediately finding a way to turn it violent in the best possible sense is part of the ritual. Beach-party energy hits different out here. The air is warm, the water is right there, and somehow the riffs land harder because the setting makes no sense. During Silly Goose, the so-called “wall of death” didn’t happen on land — it happened in the ocean, bodies splitting in the waves before crashing together like a moving tide of chaos. It wasn’t a pit, it was a wave of death. Paradise with a soundtrack that punches holes in the sky. If you’ve never watched a crowd turn tropical sand and seawater into a battleground, you’re missing one of the strangest, most satisfying crossovers in festival culture.\n\nOffstage is its own ecosystem too. Shiprocked doesn’t just book bands — it engineers situations. Games, theme nights, hangouts, goofy competitions, late-night surprises… all the little moments that land festivals can’t really pull off because everyone disperses back to hotels and cars. Here, you’re all stuck together, which is exactly why it works. The ship becomes the venue, the backstage, and the afterparty all at once. You can stumble into something unplanned at any moment — a jam, a cameo, a random acoustic set, or a crowd singalong that starts as a joke and spirals into something unforgettable. One of the purest moments of the week came around 2 a.m. at the piano bar, when Brandon Saller of Atreyu casually took over and belted out Whitney Houston’s “I Wanna Dance With Somebody,” turning a room full of exhausted metalheads into a delirious, smiling choir. It’s chaotic in the best way: spontaneous, unforced, and painfully human.\n\nNow for the blunt sentence you already know is true: Shiprocked is punishing. A week of late nights, loud days, sun exposure, and constant movement will chew you up. Your voice will crack. Your feet will hate you. Your sleep schedule will look like it got hit by a truck. Good. That’s the price of admission. If you’re looking for comfort, book a spa cruise and listen to acoustic covers by the pool. Shiprocked is for people who want to feel alive — bruised, sunburned, ringing, and stupidly grateful for it.\n\nThe Stowaways tear through a late-night main deck set, turning cover songs into full-blown chaos under smoke and stage lights.\n\nIf you’re even thinking about doing a future voyage, start with the official source at [Shiprocked.com](https://www.shiprocked.com/). That’s where the real details live — ships, routes, theme nights, and everything you need to know before committing to a week of controlled chaos. As of now, Shiprocked 2026 is already sold out, which should tell you everything about the demand. The good news is the waitlist is open, and if history says anything, spots do open up. If you’re serious about getting on board, that’s the move.\n\nAnd because a week on a metal cruise is basically endurance sport cosplay, do yourself a favor: pack like you’ve got survival instincts. High-fidelity earplugs are non-negotiable (your future self will thank you) — I’ve used [Eargasm High Fidelity Earplugs](https://amzn.to/4pTc7hY) for loud environments without turning everything into mush. Bring a stupid amount of sunscreen (the Caribbean doesn’t care about your toughness! Worst sunburn is the one award you don’t want to win) — [Sun Bum SPF 50](https://amzn.to/4sfxVpM) is a solid go-to. A compact, cruise-safe power setup is also clutch for keeping your phone alive through nonstop photos and set tracking — a simple [cruise-approved power strip](https://amzn.to/49cgMEG) saves your cabin from becoming a charging war zone. If you’re traveling in from out of state (or out of country), grab basic [waterproof travel pouch gear](https://amzn.to/3L3jLHC) so your essentials don’t get sacrificed to the sea gods.\n\nShiprocked 2025 was everything it’s supposed to be: loud, sweaty, weirdly wholesome, and violently fun. A week where the ocean is the backdrop, the ship is the venue, and the scene becomes a temporary floating kingdom. It doesn’t need to be “for everyone.” Most things that matter aren’t. For those of us who get it, this is the pilgrimage — and it hits harder every time.\n\n**More festival coverage:** [Festival Reviews](https://metal-mantra.com/festival-reviews/)\n\nMore Metal Mantra: [News](https://metal-mantra.com/news/) | [Tours & Tickets](https://metal-mantra.com/tours/)\n",
