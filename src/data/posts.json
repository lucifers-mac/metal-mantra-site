    "content": "\n<p>If you spend any time in a car, at the gym, or on a plane, you already know that Audible is the move. What you might not know is how deep the metal catalog goes. Band biographies, oral histories, frontman memoirs \u2014 there is a legitimate library of heavy music storytelling sitting in there, and most of it is narrated by the people who lived it. Here are the ones worth your time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>New to Audible? Every title on this list is available on a free 30-day trial. <a href=\"https://www.audible.com/search?keywords=metal+biography&#038;tag=metalmantra08-20\" rel=\"sponsored noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Start your free trial here</a> and you can grab one of these for nothing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Mustaine: A Heavy Metal Memoir \u2014 Dave Mustaine</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The definitive metal autobiography. Dave Mustaine covers everything \u2014 the Metallica years, the humiliating ouster, the descent into addiction, the Megadeth era, and the faith that pulled him back. It&#8217;s 11 hours and 38 minutes of the kind of honesty that most people in his position would never put on record. Narrated by Tom Wayland with over 1,100 ratings. This is the one you start with. <a href=\"https://www.audible.com/search?keywords=Mustaine+A+Heavy+Metal+Memoir+Dave+Mustaine&#038;tag=metalmantra08-20\" rel=\"sponsored noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Listen on Audible</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Confess: The Autobiography \u2014 Rob Halford</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Halford narrates his own story, which already makes it required listening. The Metal God walks through five decades of Judas Priest, his 1998 public coming out, his battles with addiction, and what it means to have lived a life at the center of heavy metal culture. 13 hours, 1,458 ratings, narrated by the man himself. There is no better way to hear this story than in his voice. <a href=\"https://www.audible.com/search?keywords=Confess+Rob+Halford+autobiography&#038;tag=metalmantra08-20\" rel=\"sponsored noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Listen on Audible</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Down with the System \u2014 Serj Tankian</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>System of a Down&#8217;s frontman delivers something you would not expect from a metal memoir \u2014 a deeply political, philosophical, and genuinely moving account of growing up Armenian-American, building one of the most distinct bands in modern heavy music, and carrying the weight of genocide recognition as a public mission. Narrated by Tankian himself, almost 10 hours. One of the more surprising listens on this list. <a href=\"https://www.audible.com/search?keywords=Down+with+the+System+Serj+Tankian&#038;tag=metalmantra08-20\" rel=\"sponsored noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Listen on Audible</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The First 21 \u2014 Nikki Sixx</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Nikki Sixx already told the M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce story in <em>The Dirt</em>. This one goes further back \u2014 the first 21 years of his life before any of that happened. The abuse, the abandonment, the desperation that drove him toward music in the first place. Narrated by Sixx himself, 5 hours 29 minutes. If you&#8217;ve read <em>The Dirt</em> and want to understand where he actually came from, this is the companion piece. <a href=\"https://www.audible.com/search?keywords=The+First+21+Nikki+Sixx&#038;tag=metalmantra08-20\" rel=\"sponsored noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Listen on Audible</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Biblical: Rob Halford&#8217;s Heavy Metal Scriptures \u2014 Rob Halford</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Less memoir, more manifesto. Halford wrote this as a love letter to heavy metal \u2014 the culture, the fans, the history, and what it all means to the people who never grew out of it. 12 hours and 38 minutes, narrated by Halford himself again. If <em>Confess</em> is his life story, <em>Biblical</em> is his philosophy. Read them back to back. <a href=\"https://www.audible.com/search?keywords=Biblical+Rob+Halford+Heavy+Metal+Scriptures&#038;tag=metalmantra08-20\" rel=\"sponsored noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Listen on Audible</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">I Am Ozzy \u2014 Ozzy Osbourne</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ozzy narrates his own insanity across 12 hours \u2014 Black Sabbath, the bat, the dove, the Sharon years, the reality TV era, and the solo career that turned him into a solo legend in his own right. It is, predictably, hilarious and terrifying in equal measure. Required reading (or listening) for anyone who wants to understand how heavy metal became a cultural institution. <a href=\"https://www.audible.com/search?keywords=I+Am+Ozzy+Osbourne&#038;tag=metalmantra08-20\" rel=\"sponsored noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Listen on Audible</a></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>Every title above is available with a free 30-day Audible trial \u2014 meaning you can start one of these today for nothing. <a href=\"https://www.audible.com/?tag=metalmantra08-20\" rel=\"sponsored noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Start your free Audible trial here.</a> If you&#8217;re already a member, all of these are available for purchase or via your monthly credit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More from Metal Mantra:</strong> <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/\">Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/sick-new-world/\">Sick New World 2026</a></p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>Florida metalcore outfit Wage War have announced a new EP, <em>It Calls Me By Name</em>, due April 17 via Fearless Records. The five-track record is rooted hard in the band&#8217;s home state \u2014 described by the group as &#8220;shaped by Florida, the swamp, and the relentless aggression of nature.&#8221; If the lead single is any indication, this is the heaviest thing they&#8217;ve committed to tape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside the announcement, Wage War dropped the video for &#8220;Song of the Swamp,&#8221; a track built on bloodthirsty screams, dense riffage, and percussion designed to make you feel like a speedbag. The band&#8217;s framing is simple: &#8220;The tone setter. Rooted in where we&#8217;re from. Driven by Florida and the raw aggression of nature.&#8221; It&#8217;s a hard turn toward straight metal, and it lands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The full EP tracklist is: &#8220;Song of the Swamp,&#8221; &#8220;4&#215;4,&#8221; &#8220;Blindfold,&#8221; &#8220;Karma,&#8221; and &#8220;Purify.&#8221; The band says the collection isn&#8217;t a concept record but &#8220;is meant to live in its own world.&#8221; Pre-orders are open now via Fearless Records. Wage War joins a packed wave of <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-metal-tours-coming-in-2026/\">2026&#8217;s strongest touring metalcore acts</a>, including names that have already staked out major runs across the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To support the release, Wage War will headline the &#8220;It Calls Me By Name Tour&#8221; with Nevertel and Orthodox in support \u2014 a 21-date run kicking off April 28 in Phoenix and closing May 31 in St. Petersburg, FL. The tour cuts through San Francisco, Chicago, New York, and Atlanta before ending on home turf.

    "content": "\n<p>It&#8217;s official. Metallica are taking over the Sphere in Las Vegas this October \u2014 the first metal band to ever play the venue. The <strong>&#8220;Life Burns Faster&#8221;</strong> residency runs eight shows across four weekends, continuing the No Repeat Weekend format that&#8217;s defined the M72 world tour since 2023. No two nights will share a setlist. That alone makes this more than a residency \u2014 it&#8217;s eight distinct Metallica shows inside the most technologically advanced concert venue on the planet.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What We Know About the Residency</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The M72 tour has already played to more than four million fans across all seven continents since its spring 2023 launch, and it&#8217;s been universally regarded as one of the best production runs of Metallica&#8217;s career. The Sphere residency takes that momentum and drops it into a venue built specifically for immersive live experiences \u2014 the world&#8217;s highest-resolution LED display wrapping up, over, and around the audience, spatial audio that delivers studio-grade clarity to every seat, and multi-sensory 4D technology. Lars Ulrich has been talking about wanting to do this since he saw U2&#8217;s opening night in 2023. His quote says it all: &#8220;About 12 seconds into the opening night of Sphere with U2, I thought, &#8216;We have to do this.&#8217; This residency gives us another chance to reinvent how we interact with our fans in a live setting. Way fuckin&#8217; psyched to go next level.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sphere has hosted U2, Eagles, Dead &amp; Company, Phish, and No Doubt \u2014 but no metal band has touched it until now. Metallica being first isn&#8217;t just a milestone for the band. It&#8217;s a milestone for the genre. Heavy music in the most advanced live venue ever built, with a production team that&#8217;s already spent three years pushing the boundaries of what a stadium show can be.

The Sphere is the one venue that could genuinely offer them something they haven&#8217;t done before. The immersive tech, the spatial audio, the visual scale \u2014 this isn&#8217;t a band resting on legacy. This is a band that sold out stadiums for three straight years and decided the next move is to go somewhere that doesn&#8217;t even have a playbook yet. The <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/metallica-m72-at-levis-stadium-santa-clara-review/\">M72 tour already proved they&#8217;re operating at peak level</a>. The Sphere residency is what happens when you take that energy and put it inside a building designed to amplify it in every direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mark March 6 for general sale.

    "title": "Death Angel Announce Act III 35th Anniversary Tour Leg 2 With Vio-lence + Incite \u2014 35 U.S. Dates",
    "content": "\n<p>Death Angel are heading back out for the second leg of the <strong>Act III U.S. Tour</strong>, and they&#8217;re bringing Vio-lence and Incite along for the ride. The run kicks off <strong>May 1 in Phoenix</strong> and wraps <strong>June 21 in Santa Cruz</strong>, covering 35 dates across the country \u2014 including stops at Welcome To Rockville, Maryland Deathfest, and MKE Metal Fest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tour celebrates the <strong>35th anniversary of <em>Act III</em></strong> with full-album performances every night. That&#8217;s not a greatest-hits set with one deep cut thrown in as a bonus \u2014 it&#8217;s the entire record, front to back, the way it was meant to be heard. For a band that came out of the Bay Area thrash scene and helped define its second wave, this is the kind of commitment that separates a real legacy tour from a nostalgia lap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vocalist Mark Osegueda said the first leg exceeded expectations: &#8220;Nightly we could see and even more-so hear it at every show. That you guys appreciated it beyond our wildest expectations.&#8221; The response was strong enough to warrant a second run \u2014 and this time the routing is deeper, hitting more mid-market rooms where thrash tours tend to hit hardest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pairing Death Angel with <strong>Vio-lence</strong> on the same bill is a Bay Area thrash double-header that doesn&#8217;t need a third name to sell it. Both bands came up in the same scene, and seeing them on the same stage in 2026 is the kind of package that rewards people who actually show up. <strong>Incite</strong> rounds out the bill with enough aggression to keep the energy locked in from doors to encore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tickets:</strong> <a href=\"https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Ddeath%2Bangel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Get Death Angel 2026 tour tickets</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>More tour coverage: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tours/\">Metal Tours &amp; Tickets Hub</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Death Angel 2026 Act III U.S. Tour Dates</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>May 1 \u2014 Phoenix, AZ \u2014 Marquee Theater</li>\n<li>May 3 \u2014 Oklahoma City, OK \u2014 Diamond Ballroom</li>\n<li>May 5 \u2014 New Orleans, LA \u2014 House of Blues</li>\n<li>May 7 \u2014 Daytona, FL \u2014 Welcome To Rockville</li>\n<li>May 10 \u2014 Charlotte, NC \u2014 The Underground</li>\n<li>May 11 \u2014 Asheville, NC \u2014 Orange Peel</li>\n<li>May 12 \u2014 Hobart, IN \u2014 Hobart Theater</li>\n<li>May 14 \u2014 Detroit, MI \u2014 St. Andrews Hall</li>\n<li>May 15 \u2014 Sayreville, NJ \u2014 Starland Ballroom</li>\n<li>May 16 \u2014 Norwalk, CT \u2014 District Music Hall</li>\n<li>May 19 \u2014 Wilmington, DE \u2014 The Queen</li>\n<li>May 20 \u2014 New York, NY \u2014 Gramercy Theater</li>\n<li>May 21 \u2014 Buffalo, NY \u2014 Electric City</li>\n<li>May 22 \u2014 Allentown, PA \u2014 Archer Music Hall</li>\n<li>May 24 \u2014 Baltimore, MD \u2014 Maryland Deathfest</li>\n<li>May 27 \u2014 Atlanta, GA \u2014 Masquerade (Hell)</li>\n<li>May 28 \u2014 Orlando, FL \u2014 The Abbey</li>\n<li>May 29 \u2014 Ft.

    "content": "\n<p>Midweek and the news cycle is swinging heavy. Iron Maiden is all over this one \u2014 Rock Hall nomination and a documentary in the same breath. A major vocalist exit, a Ghost pause nobody&#8217;s surprised by, and AI-generated garbage getting publicly torched. Here&#8217;s what actually matters today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quick Actions: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tours/\">Browse active metal tours</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/\">Past Rundowns</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Iron Maiden and Black Crowes Among 2026 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Nominees</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame dropped its 2026 nominee list today, and Iron Maiden is finally on it. Seventeen artists total \u2014 including the Black Crowes, Oasis, Joy Division/New Order, Billy Idol, and a handful of pop names that&#8217;ll start arguments in every comment section on the internet. Ten of the nominees are first-timers. Maiden&#8217;s inclusion is long overdue for a band that&#8217;s been filling stadiums globally for five decades, and their 50th anniversary tour is still actively rolling. Fan voting is open now, inductees get announced in April, and the ceremony hits sometime this fall. If Maiden doesn&#8217;t get in this year after a Hall of Fame nomination, a documentary, and a world tour all running simultaneously, the institution has lost the plot entirely.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Iron Maiden&#8217;s &#8216;Burning Ambition&#8217; Documentary Hitting Theaters May 7</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of Maiden \u2014 their five-decade story is getting a proper theatrical release. <em>Iron Maiden: Burning Ambition</em>, directed by Malcolm Venville, lands in cinemas May 7 for a limited run, with tickets going on sale March 18. The film features current and archival interviews with the band plus outside voices like Lars Ulrich, Chuck D, and actor Javier Bardem. Between this, the ongoing Run for Your Lives tour, and the newly announced EddFest two-day event at Knebworth this July \u2014 complete with an Eddie-themed museum and fairground rides \u2014 Maiden&#8217;s 50th year is turning into a full-scale campaign. Mark March 18 for tickets. Limited theatrical runs don&#8217;t stick around.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Better Lovers Part Ways With Greg Puciato</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Better Lovers \u2014 the band that rose from the wreckage of Every Time I Die \u2014 announced they&#8217;re parting ways with vocalist Greg Puciato. The remaining four (Jordan Buckley, Will Putney, Stephen Micciche, Clayton Holyoak) say they&#8217;re finishing a new album and actively searching for a new singer. Puciato responded on Instagram with zero drama: &#8220;No bad blood. Everyone&#8217;s cool. Don&#8217;t speculate. Long live the frog.&#8221; He&#8217;s already locked into Jerry Cantrell&#8217;s live band and just reactivated The Black Queen for spring shows, so he&#8217;s not exactly sitting around. The split comes barely two years after their debut album <em>Highly Irresponsible</em>, which makes this a short but productive chapter. The real question now is whether Better Lovers can find a voice that matches what Puciato brought \u2014 or if this becomes a fundamentally different band.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tobias Forge Says Ghost Will Go on Hiatus After the Skeletour</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tobias Forge confirmed what a lot of fans have been sensing \u2014 Ghost has nothing planned beyond the current Skelet\u00e1 tour cycle. In an interview on Full Metal Jackie&#8217;s radio show, Forge was unusually candid about burnout after 15 years of building Ghost from the ground up. He compared his role to being a house builder who handles everything from permits to tiling, and admitted he&#8217;s run out of materials. He&#8217;s got two film projects in development and already recorded an album with a different project before this tour started, so he&#8217;s not disappearing. But for Ghost specifically, this is the first real pause since <em>Opus Eponymous</em>. The rare case where a frontman at the peak of momentum says &#8220;I&#8217;m actually fine if I lose it&#8221; \u2014 and sounds like he means it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Philip Anselmo Shuts Down AI-Generated Health Rumors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Pantera frontman Philip Anselmo went on social media Tuesday to kill a round of fake AI-generated posts claiming he was battling blood cancer. His response was direct \u2014 it&#8217;s all bull. The whole thing was fabricated by AI content farms, and Anselmo made sure fans heard it from him before the rumor machine could run any further. This is becoming a recurring and genuinely dangerous problem across the music world as AI-generated misinformation gets more convincing and spreads faster than corrections can travel. If you saw those posts circulating, they were fake. Anselmo is fine. Pantera is still active. Don&#8217;t share garbage you can&#8217;t verify.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Voivod&#8217;s Denis &#8220;Snake&#8221; B\u00e9langer&#8217;s Wife Battling Stage 4 Cancer \u2014 GoFundMe Launched</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Voivod have reached out to their fanbase for support after revealing that Christine McDonald, partner of frontman Denis &#8220;Snake&#8221; B\u00e9langer, was diagnosed with Stage 4 colorectal cancer last October. The cancer has metastasized to her liver, ovary, and abdominal wall. Treatment is ongoing and showing some positive signs, but it&#8217;s intensive \u2014 daily injections, chemotherapy, and constant hospital visits. The financial strain has been severe, impacting both McDonald&#8217;s ability to work and B\u00e9langer&#8217;s capacity to maintain his commitments with the band. A GoFundMe has been set up to help with medical costs and living expenses. If Voivod&#8217;s music has meant something to you over the last four decades, this is one of those moments where showing up matters more than sharing a post.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tom Morello Postpones Solo Tour to Join Bruce Springsteen on the Road</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tom Morello has shelved his planned spring solo tour to hit the road with Bruce Springsteen instead. No elaborate explanation \u2014 when The Boss calls, you take the gig. Morello&#8217;s been a recurring presence in Springsteen&#8217;s live setup and the chemistry is well documented at this point. For fans who had tickets to the solo dates, the postponement stings, but the tradeoff is Morello playing to massive rooms with one of rock&#8217;s greatest live performers. Expect rescheduled solo dates once the Springsteen commitment wraps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More Metal Mantra: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/\">Rundowns</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More from Metal Mantra:</strong> <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/\">Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/iron-maiden-discography-legacy/\">Iron Maiden Discography &#038; Legacy</a></p>\n",

    "title": "SLAYER To Celebrate 40 Years Of Reign In Blood At Rocklahoma 2026",
    "content": "\n<p>Forty years after <em>Reign In Blood</em> rewired what thrash metal could be, Slayer is heading to Rocklahoma 2026 to mark the occasion. The announcement confirms the band will celebrate the landmark album&#8217;s 40th anniversary at the annual Oklahoma festival \u2014 a pairing that makes almost too much sense. Big outdoor stage. Hardcore crowd. One of the most visceral records in metal history. This is exactly where that celebration belongs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Reign In Blood Still Matters 40 Years Later</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Reign In Blood</em> dropped October 7, 1986 on Def American Records and immediately broke something in the metal world that hasn&#8217;t fully healed since. Twenty-nine minutes. Ten tracks. No filler, no breathing room, no compromise. From the opening blast of &#8220;Angel of Death&#8221; to the closing chaos of &#8220;Raining Blood,&#8221; the album operated like a machine designed to do one thing at maximum efficiency: destroy. It didn&#8217;t ease you in. It didn&#8217;t cool down. It just went.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What Kerry King, Jeff Hanneman, Tom Araya, and Dave Lombardo built on that record wasn&#8217;t just fast \u2014 it was precise. The riffs weren&#8217;t chaos for its own sake. They were surgical. Lombardo&#8217;s double-bass work on tracks like &#8220;Piece by Piece&#8221; and &#8220;Criminally Insane&#8221; set a benchmark that thrash drummers are still chasing. Araya&#8217;s vocal delivery landed somewhere between preacher and executioner. And Hanneman&#8217;s writing gave the whole thing a thematic darkness that went beyond shock value into something genuinely unsettling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The album didn&#8217;t just influence a generation. It defined a ceiling for how extreme mainstream metal could get \u2014 then dared everyone else to reach it. Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax \u2014 the rest of the Big Four had their own lanes. Slayer had a bunker. <em>Reign In Blood</em> was the ceiling, the floor, and the walls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pick up <em>Reign In Blood</em>:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Reign-Blood-Slayer/dp/B000002JDL?tag=metalmantra-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Get it on Amazon</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Rocklahoma 2026 \u2014 The Setting Fits</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Rocklahoma has built its reputation as one of the premier outdoor rock and metal festivals in the US, drawing heavy crowds to Pryor, Oklahoma every September. It&#8217;s a festival that respects the genre&#8217;s history while keeping the live energy front and center \u2014 no pretension, no polish, just a massive field of people there for the music. That&#8217;s the right room for a Slayer anniversary set.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 20th anniversary edition of Rocklahoma is stacking names \u2014 Godsmack headlines Friday, Papa Roach takes Saturday, and Slayer closes out Sunday with the <em>Reign In Blood</em> celebration. The undercard is deep too: Stone Temple Pilots, Black Label Society, Suicidal Tendencies, Dropkick Murphys, Pennywise, The Pretty Reckless, and dozens more. It&#8217;s one of the strongest festival bills of the year. If you&#8217;re tracking the 2026 festival circuit, this sits right alongside the <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/louder-than-life-2026-lineup-announced-iron-maiden-tool-pantera-mcr-nearly-200-bands/\">Louder Than Life lineup</a> and <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/inkcarceration-2026-lineup/\">Inkcarceration</a> as a must-watch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A 40th anniversary celebration of <em>Reign In Blood</em> is the kind of event that festival crowds show up early for. Whether that means a full album run, a career-spanning set that leans heavy on the classic era, or something in between, the context alone makes it appointment viewing. This isn&#8217;t nostalgia tourism. It&#8217;s a legitimate moment for one of metal&#8217;s most consequential records to get the stage treatment it deserves from the band that made it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What To Expect</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Slayer performing in the context of a <em>Reign In Blood</em> anniversary raises the obvious question: are they playing it front to back? That format has worked for other legacy artists \u2014 <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/death-angel-act-iii-tour-2026/\">Death Angel is doing the same thing right now with <em>Act III</em></a> \u2014 and it works especially well with <em>Reign In Blood</em> because the album functions as a complete statement. Running it in sequence wouldn&#8217;t be a gimmick. It would be the logical choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Details beyond the announcement are still coming, but the confirmation alone is enough. Slayer at Rocklahoma, 40 years of <em>Reign In Blood</em>, September 2026 in Pryor, Oklahoma.

    "title": "Mike Patton Hints at Quiet Closure for Faith No More\u2019s Final Run",
    "content": "\n<p>Mike Patton is talking about Faith No More again, and the way he\u2019s talking about it matters. In a recent interview, he described the band\u2019s final run as carrying a sense of \u201cclosure\u201d \u2014 not a headline\u2011grabbing breakup, but the kind of quiet understanding that sometimes settles in during the last shows of a long story. That framing doesn\u2019t slam the door. It lets it stay cracked, which is exactly why this moment feels important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a band with a legacy this deep \u2014 and for a city like San Francisco that still feels their fingerprints on everything heavy and weird \u2014 even a soft hint of finality hits hard. But Faith No More have never been a neat, linear narrative. They\u2019ve been a constellation: the record\u2011breaking highs, the long gaps, the reunion era, the one\u2011foot\u2011in\u2011the\u2011future restlessness. If this is the end, it deserves the full context. And if it isn\u2019t, that context is exactly why the story still has fuel.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Faith No More didn\u2019t just influence a scene \u2014 they rewired it</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Faith No More\u2019s impact isn\u2019t a footnote in alternative metal; it\u2019s the foundation. Their 1989 breakthrough <em>The Real Thing</em> didn\u2019t just put them on the map \u2014 it cracked the idea of what heavy music could be. It wasn\u2019t purely thrash. It wasn\u2019t purely rock. It was a collision: groove, funk, art\u2011school oddness, aggression, and the kind of theatrical tension that made everything feel dangerous.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then came <em>Angel Dust</em> in 1992 \u2014 a record that still confounds categories and is stronger now than it was when it first landed. That album is the DNA line for countless bands that followed. Nu\u2011metal, alternative metal, post\u2011hardcore, even modern metalcore and progressive scenes borrowed its blueprint: dynamic shifts, a fearless sense of arrangement, a refusal to be boxed in. When you hear bands that sound like they\u2019re dragging multiple genres into one room and locking the door behind them, you\u2019re hearing echoes of Faith No More.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it wasn\u2019t just the genre blend. It was the attitude: no apologies, no script, no reason to conform. The band\u2019s legacy is full of acts who became themselves because Faith No More already proved that \u201cyourself\u201d could be loud, surreal, and uncompromising. There are decades of bands who probably wouldn\u2019t exist in their current form without Faith No More showing the pathway.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bay Area roots, global impact</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>San Francisco isn\u2019t just a backdrop in the Faith No More story \u2014 it\u2019s the engine. This is a Bay Area band through and through, born out of a city that has always been willing to let the weird rise to the surface. The band\u2019s early history lives in that regional mix of punk, metal, art, and experimental chaos that made Northern California a different kind of breeding ground. If you grew up around the scene, Faith No More weren\u2019t \u201cjust a band.\u201d They were proof that the local sound could go global without being diluted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That Bay Area identity matters now more than ever because it anchors the legacy in place, not just in time. As the city continues to evolve, Faith No More remains one of the clearest cultural markers of what the area has contributed to heavy music: intelligence, risk, and a sense of individuality that still feels rare.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Patton era and the long shadow of the catalogue</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike Patton\u2019s arrival didn\u2019t just change the band\u2019s sound \u2014 it expanded their vocabulary. His voice became an instrument of extremes: melodic and deranged, tender and violent, controlled and feral. That versatility didn\u2019t just define the band\u2019s peak; it set a bar for frontmen across the next three decades. If you\u2019ve ever heard a vocalist snap from clean hooks to animalistic chaos in a single breath, you\u2019ve heard a lineage that traces back to Patton.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Albums like <em>King for a Day\u2026 Fool for a Lifetime</em> and <em>Album of the Year</em> kept moving the target even as the industry around them kept trying to standardize what \u201calternative metal\u201d meant. Faith No More never let that label stick. They kept mutating, even when it made them harder to market. And that stubborn refusal to simplify is why the catalogue still feels alive instead of dated.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The reunion era: not nostalgia, a second life</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When Faith No More reunited in 2009, it didn\u2019t feel like a nostalgia lap. It felt like a second life. The band was vital on stage, and the return gave a newer generation the chance to see a blueprint band in real time. That era also led to <em>Sol Invictus</em> in 2015 \u2014 a record that proved they still had something to say beyond the shadow of their past.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s what makes the present so complicated. The reunion era wasn\u2019t a simple reunion. It was its own chapter. It carried forward long enough to feel permanent, then paused in a way that felt unresolved. And now, with Patton describing a quiet sense of closure, the story sits in this tension between \u201cfinished\u201d and \u201cunfinished.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why the \u201cclosure\u201d comment matters</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Patton\u2019s recent comment about an \u201cunspoken\u201d sense of closure lands because it\u2019s not dramatic \u2014 it\u2019s honest. The last stretch of Faith No More shows felt significant even when they weren\u2019t framed as a farewell. That\u2019s a deeply human thing: you often realize a chapter is ending only after it\u2019s already over.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t really think so at the time, but, yeah, maybe,\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAnd I think that we all kind of felt it, but it was unspoken.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s funny: when you\u2019ve been in a band or a musical situation for a period of time, you always, in the back of your head, you\u2019re kind of thinking, \u2018Well, maybe this is it.\u2019 And I don\u2019t mind that feeling. I don\u2019t see it as a sad thing. I see it as being present and being able to really appreciate it while it\u2019s happening.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>He also reiterated something fans often forget: Faith No More was never a \u201cmain project\u201d to him. It was one of many lanes he ran at full speed. That doesn\u2019t diminish the band; it explains the operating system. If everything he does is equal, then nothing gets forced. And that means any return \u2014 if it happens \u2014 will be because it feels right, not because it\u2019s expected.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The broader band context: friction, distance, and respect</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The public record over the past few years has been clear enough: the 2021 tour was scrapped due to Patton\u2019s mental health struggles, and the reunion momentum never fully recovered. Other members have acknowledged the strain and the uncertainty. None of that is shocking. It\u2019s the reality of a band with decades of history, strong personalities, and the weight of expectation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there\u2019s also something else in those interviews: a consistent respect for what the band already achieved. Even when the future sounds murky, there\u2019s no sense of regret in the way they talk about what they built. That matters, because it keeps the story from feeling bitter. It keeps the legacy intact.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why this story deserves a full feature now</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If Faith No More are truly done, the importance isn\u2019t just that a legendary band ends \u2014 it\u2019s that a specific type of band ends. They\u2019re one of the few acts that truly cut a new shape into heavy music, and their influence is so widespread that we often forget where it came from. From alternative metal to modern metalcore to genre\u2011agnostic heavy artists, their fingerprints are everywhere: dynamic song structures, left\u2011turn arrangements, and the confidence to be strange without apologizing for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for Metal Mantra, this is personal. Faith No More are a Bay Area institution. Their story is tied to the geography, the scene, the culture. Covering them isn\u2019t just about documenting a band \u2014 it\u2019s about documenting a piece of the city\u2019s identity in heavy music.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The glimmer of hope</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, this doesn\u2019t read like a final goodbye. Faith No More have always operated in cycles, not straight lines. They\u2019ve gone silent and returned before. They\u2019ve ended chapters and started new ones when no one expected it. Patton\u2019s words sound like a man at peace with what was \u2014 not a man slamming the gate on what could be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this feature isn\u2019t a eulogy. It\u2019s a marker in the story. It\u2019s a moment to acknowledge the weight of the legacy and the possibility that, one day, the band could decide to step back into the light for one more run \u2014 or even one more song.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because with Faith No More, the end is never fully written until they write it themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>To be continued.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>More Metal Mantra: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/news/\">News</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/\">Rundowns</a></p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>Monday hits with tour shifts, new music drops, and a festival lineup that keeps stacking. Here\u2019s what matters right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Burton C. Bell Won\u2019t Sign His Final Fear Factory Album</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Former Fear Factory vocalist Burton C. Bell said he won\u2019t sign copies of <em>Aggression Continuum</em>, citing how the record was changed after his final involvement. It\u2019s a rare case of a frontman drawing a hard line on a legacy release, and it underscores just how fractured that exit became. For longtime fans, it\u2019s a reminder that the band\u2019s last chapter wasn\u2019t just a lineup change \u2014 it was a split with lasting tension.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Beartooth Debut New Song \u201cFree\u201d Live</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Beartooth premiered a new track, \u201cFree,\u201d during their Salt Lake City set, which is usually the first signal that a new cycle is moving from studio to stage. Live debuts like this aren\u2019t just hype \u2014 they test how the material lands in a room. If the song stays in the set, it\u2019s a strong indicator the release timeline is already mapped.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Nothing Premiere \u201cNever Come Never Morning\u201d Video</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing dropped the \u201cNever Come Never Morning\u201d video, keeping their current run of releases active with another visual anchor. The band\u2019s recent visuals have leaned into the same haze\u2011soaked atmosphere as the music, and this one stays in that lane. It\u2019s a clean signal that their rollout is still building, not pausing between singles.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Fallujah + Allegaeon Booked For 2026 Loud As Hell Festival</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Fallujah and Allegaeon are confirmed for 2026\u2019s Loud As Hell Festival, which immediately tilts the bill toward technical death metal. Pairing those two on the same lineup suggests the festival\u2019s aiming for credibility with the tech crowd, not just broad heavy\u2011genre coverage. If you\u2019re into precision\u2011heavy sets, this is an early marker worth tracking.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Beyond Creation Premiere \u201cReverence\u201d Video</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond Creation premiered the \u201cReverence\u201d video, continuing their momentum with a fresh visual drop. For a band whose fanbase pays attention to detail, a new video isn\u2019t just filler \u2014 it\u2019s part of the cycle\u2019s narrative. Expect this to be the anchor piece while they keep the next wave of content rolling.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pennywise Announce Spring 2026 West Coast Tour (w/ Circle Jerks, H2O, DFL)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Pennywise announced a Spring 2026 West Coast run with Circle Jerks, H2O, and DFL \u2014 a package built for old\u2011school pit energy and hard\u2011ticket loyalty. These are the kinds of lineups that sell fast in core punk markets because the overlap is real. If you\u2019re on the fence, don\u2019t wait for the last week \u2014 the rooms on these tours tend to tighten quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Alex Van Halen Plans Project With Steve Lukather Using Unreleased Eddie Material</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Alex Van Halen revealed a new project with Steve Lukather built around unreleased Eddie Van Halen material. That\u2019s not just archival talk \u2014 it implies there\u2019s enough quality material to justify a full project, not a one\u2011off tribute. If this moves forward, it\u2019ll be a major moment for the Van Halen legacy and a likely headline cycle on its own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More Metal Mantra: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tours/\">Tours &amp; Tickets Hub</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/news/\">News</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tour links: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tours/\">Metal Tours &amp; Tickets Hub</a> | Featured: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/amon-amarth-dethklok-tour/\">Amon Amarth + Dethklok tour</a></p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>Louder Than Life has officially dropped its full 2026 lineup \u2014 and it\u2019s the biggest bill in the festival\u2019s history. The Danny Wimmer Presents flagship returns to the Kentucky Exposition Center in Louisville on September 17\u201320 with nearly 200 bands across seven stages. Headliners are locked, the undercard is stacked, and a mystery guest plus a major \u201cvery special guest\u201d are still to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the kind of lineup that resets the fall festival calendar. Louder Than Life is already DWP\u2019s loudest weekend, but this year\u2019s booking leans harder into breadth: legacy headliners, modern arena draws, metalcore heat, and a deep bench of reunions and exclusives.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Louder Than Life 2026 \u2014 Dates, Location, Headliners</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sept. 17\u201320, 2026</strong> \u2022 Kentucky Exposition Center \u2022 Louisville, KY</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Thursday (Sept 17):</strong> <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/iron-maiden/\">Iron Maiden</a>, <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/pantera/\">Pantera</a>, <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/megadeth/\">Megadeth</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Friday (Sept 18):</strong> My Chemical Romance, Pierce The Veil, A Day to Remember</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Saturday (Sept 19):</strong> Limp Bizkit, Papa Roach, Sublime</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Sunday (Sept 20):</strong> TOOL, Gojira, Danny Elfman</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why this year is a must</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Louder Than Life has always been a scene-wide crossover point \u2014 metal lifers, core kids, punk diehards, and hard-rock crowds sharing the same concrete.

    "content": "\n<p>UK-based collective PRESIDENT have released the video for new single &#8220;Angel Wings,&#8221; their first track under Atlantic Records. It&#8217;s the most direct signal yet that PRESIDENT are building toward something larger \u2014 a mix of alt-rock, industrial texture, and programmed beats that sits at the heavier end of the band&#8217;s sonic range without fully crossing into metal territory. The band describes the song as exploring &#8220;spiritual redemption and the resolve to begin again,&#8221; and frames it as the opening of a new chapter.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"PRESIDENT - Angel Wings\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XE68ORLCqa4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Angel Wings&#8221; follows PRESIDENT&#8217;s 2025 debut EP <em>King of Terrors</em> and arrives as their first release for Atlantic Records. The band operates deliberately under a cloak of minimalism and anonymity \u2014 no press photos, controlled rollouts, no social noise \u2014 which has made each release land with more weight than the typical promo cycle. They told <em>Revolver</em> in a cover feature that they wanted to step back from &#8220;the conveyor belt&#8221; of modern music industry churn. The approach is working. Multi-million streams and a Revolver cover without having played a headline show yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>PRESIDENT are currently mid-tour opening for <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/review-left-for-good-bad-omens/\">Bad Omens</a> and Beartooth on a North American arena run through March 27. Remaining dates include TD Garden in Boston (March 11), Xfinity Mobile Arena in Philadelphia (March 13), Bridgestone Arena in Nashville (March 17), American Airlines Center in Dallas (March 19), and the Kia Forum in Inglewood (March 26). For a band still on their first EP, these are rooms that will do their reputation real work. <a href=\"https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fbad-omens-tickets%2Fartist%2F2206691\" rel=\"sponsored noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Tickets for remaining dates are available now.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">PRESIDENT \u2014 Remaining Tour Dates (with Bad Omens + Beartooth)</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Feb 26 \u2013 Kansas City, MO \u2013 T-Mobile Center</li>\n\n<li>Feb 28 \u2013 Detroit, MI \u2013 Little Caesars Arena</li>\n\n<li>Mar 2 \u2013 Minneapolis, MN \u2013 Target Center</li>\n\n<li>Mar 4 \u2013 Rosemont, IL \u2013 Allstate Arena</li>\n\n<li>Mar 6 \u2013 Toronto, ON \u2013 Scotiabank Arena</li>\n\n<li>Mar 8 \u2013 Laval, QC \u2013 Place Bell</li>\n\n<li>Mar 10 \u2013 Newark, NJ \u2013 Prudential Center</li>\n\n<li>Mar 11 \u2013 Boston, MA \u2013 TD Garden</li>\n\n<li>Mar 13 \u2013 Philadelphia, PA \u2013 Xfinity Mobile Arena</li>\n\n<li>Mar 14 \u2013 Baltimore, MD \u2013 CFG Bank Arena</li>\n\n<li>Mar 16 \u2013 Raleigh, NC \u2013 Lenovo Center</li>\n\n<li>Mar 17 \u2013 Nashville, TN \u2013 Bridgestone Arena</li>\n\n<li>Mar 19 \u2013 Dallas, TX \u2013 American Airlines Center</li>\n\n<li>Mar 20 \u2013 San Antonio, TX \u2013 Frost Bank Center</li>\n\n<li>Mar 22 \u2013 Oklahoma City, OK \u2013 Paycom Center</li>\n\n<li>Mar 24 \u2013 Glendale, AZ \u2013 Desert Diamond Arena</li>\n\n<li>Mar 26 \u2013 Inglewood, CA \u2013 Kia Forum</li>\n\n<li>Mar 27 \u2013 Oakland, CA \u2013 Oakland Arena</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More from Metal Mantra:</strong> <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-metal-tracks-of-2025/\">Top 10 Metal Tracks of 2025</a></p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>The midweek feed is heavy on tour movement, album rollouts, and one major lineup split. Here\u2019s what matters right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">At The Gates Preview New Album, Confirm Final Record With Tomas Lindberg</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At The Gates have started teasing <em>The Ghost Of A Future Dead</em>, billed as their final album with Tomas Lindberg. For a band this foundational to melodic death metal, that immediately raises the stakes around this cycle. If this truly closes the Lindberg chapter, expect every single, visual, and live date tied to this record to carry added weight with longtime fans.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Exodus Drop \u201cGoliath\u201d Title Track, Album Lands March 20</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Exodus just fired out the title track \u201cGoliath,\u201d with the full record due March 20. The early response is exactly what you\u2019d expect: riff-first, no compromise, and built for pit conversion. With Napalm backing the release and a fresh content push underway, this looks like a core Q1/Q2 thrash anchor, not a one-off single cycle.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Mushroomhead + Fear Factory Announce Fall Co-Headline Run</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mushroomhead and Fear Factory are teaming up for the \u201cSoul Of A New War Machine\u201d U.S. tour with Nine Treasures in support. Stylistically, this package makes sense: industrial precision, groove impact, and a support act that adds flavor without derailing the tone. This is the type of co-headline run that tends to perform strongest in established hard-ticket markets where both fanbases overlap.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Converge Expand Spring Routing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Converge added more dates to their April North American run around the Poison The Well shows. Expansion this late is usually a demand signal, not filler. It also points to confidence in market velocity for this package, especially in hardcore-forward regions where lineup credibility drives decisions fast.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Enter Shikari Lock East Coast Headline Dates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter Shikari return this June with a focused East Coast stretch, including Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Toronto. Compact regional runs like this usually hit well when there\u2019s demand but no bloated routing. If room sizes stay tight, several of these dates will move quickly once local pushes kick in.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ingested Split With Vocalist Josh Davies</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ingested announced Josh Davies is out effective immediately, with Adam Mercer stepping in for touring duties. Any abrupt vocalist change creates real pressure on both communication and live execution in the next run of shows. This one will be watched closely for fan response as the band moves through upcoming dates.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Poison The Well Drop \u201cEverything Hurts\u201d Ahead of New LP</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Poison The Well released \u201cEverything Hurts\u201d from <em>Peace In Place</em>, their first new album since 2009. That gap alone makes this rollout one of the bigger comeback arcs in heavy music right now. If they keep this level of output consistency through release day, expect renewed catalog lift and strong nostalgia-plus-discovery engagement.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Shinedown Address Rock The Country Exit</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Brent Smith publicly addressed Shinedown\u2019s decision to exit Kid Rock\u2019s Rock The Country festival. Even outside strict metal lanes, this story is moving because it intersects artist positioning, promoter friction, and public narrative control. When bands step away from a major platform, the reasoning usually becomes part of the headline for weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Lovebites Sign With Napalm, Push New Video</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Lovebites have signed with Napalm Records and launched a new video tied to their current cycle. Label shifts like this usually signal a stronger global infrastructure push across distribution, press, and tour strategy. If the rollout stays disciplined, this can be a meaningful growth phase for their international profile this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More Metal Mantra: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tours/\">Tours &amp; Tickets Hub</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/news/\">News</a></p>\n\n\n<p>Tour links: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tours/\">Metal Tours &amp; Tickets Hub</a> | Featured: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/amon-amarth-dethklok-tour/\">Amon Amarth + Dethklok tour</a></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>More from Metal Mantra:</strong> <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/\">Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026</a></p>\n",

Special guests are to be announced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The headline dates run parallel to <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/amon-amarth-dethklok-tour/\">the already-announced Amonklok Conquest Tour</a>, the co-headlining run with Amon Amarth and Castle Rat that stretches April 15 through May 21 across arenas and major venues nationwide. Between the two, Dethklok will be one of the most active metal acts of the spring season \u2014 bouncing between headline club shows and co-headline arena dates in a way that covers both ends of the audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Amonklok run includes festival appearances at <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/sonic-temple-2026/\">Sonic Temple</a> in Columbus (May 17) and Welcome to Rockville in Daytona Beach (May 7), plus major arena stops in Brooklyn, Boston, Detroit, Toronto, Montreal, and Denver.

    "content": "\n<p>Breaking Benjamin have announced a 30-date North American tour for fall 2026, running September 2 through October 24. Chevelle, Starset, and Kami Kehoe will support. Produced by Live Nation, it&#8217;s an amphitheater and arena run that opens at Freedom Mortgage Pavilion in Camden, NJ and closes at Jiffy Lube Live in Bristow, VA \u2014 with major stops in Denver, Las Vegas, Anaheim, and Fort Worth in between.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The band recently signed to BMG and dropped &#8220;Awaken,&#8221; their first new music in five years. It&#8217;s a direct statement of intent: Breaking Benjamin are not coasting on catalog. With ten number-one Active Rock singles and more than 8.5 billion combined streams worldwide, they have the history to fill rooms this size without a new album \u2014 but &#8220;Awaken&#8221; signals there&#8217;s more coming. The last studio full-length, <em>Aurora</em>, dropped in 2020 alongside the acoustic companion <em>Ember</em> (2018), which debuted at number three on the Billboard 200.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chevelle on the support slot is the right call \u2014 two bands with compatible audiences and enough muscle to hold a room independently. Starset bring a different texture, more atmospheric and theatrical, which gives the run some range on the undercard.

The lineup pairing with Landmvrks and Thousand Below strengthens the full-show experience rather than treating support as an afterthought. You get a complete night that tracks with where heavy and alternative music are colliding in 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The routing itself is efficient and built for momentum. There are no long dead zones, no obvious soft section in the middle, and no sign this is being treated like a casual run. For fans, that usually means one thing: if your market is on this list, lock your ticket early and don\u2019t wait for resale regret.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Related coverage: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/evanescence-2026-world-tour/\">Evanescence 2026 World Tour</a></p>\n\n\n<p>Festival watch: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/rock-for-people-2026-halsey-final-headliner/\">Rock for People 2026 updates</a></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>More from Metal Mantra:</strong> <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-metal-tracks-of-2025/\">Top 10 Metal Tracks of 2025</a></p>\n",

    "title": "Orbit Culture Drop Live Video for \u2018The Storm\u2019 as North American Tour Kicks Off Feb. 18",
    "content": "\n<p>Orbit Culture just dropped a live video for fan favorite \u201cThe Storm\u201d \u2014 and it\u2019s not just a clip for the algorithm. It\u2019s a document of the band\u2019s last headline run, shot with a heavy focus on Gothenburg (close to home) and built to capture what their shows actually feel like when everything locks into place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the band, the video pulls them right back to a night that \u201ccarried real weight \u2014 intense, focused, and honest.\u201d That\u2019s the point: no narrative gymnastics, no extra mythology layered on top. Just a performance that hits hard, filmed like it matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"ORBIT CULTURE - The Storm (OFFICIAL VIDEO)\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KQJY-8logFQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The timing isn\u2019t accidental. The band is about to kick off a North American run with Ov Sulfur and Atlas starting Feb. 18, and this is a clean way to remind people what they\u2019re walking into. Orbit Culture have always lived in that space where groove and brutality shake hands \u2014 riffs that hit like modern thrash and death metal, with an industrial edge that keeps it moving even when the guitars are trying to crush everything in the room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe Storm\u201d is also another visual chapter tied to <em>Death Above Life</em>, the album the band released last October. If you missed that record the first time around, this is the kind of clip that makes the sell without sounding like a sales pitch. <strong>Buy:</strong> <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4qGmvcy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Death Above Life (Orbit Culture) on Amazon</a>. The band has described <em>Death Above Life</em> as a change and a reset \u2014 guitarist/vocalist/songwriter Niklas Karlsson called it \u201ca big change for the better\u201d and framed it as a rebirth. That\u2019s dramatic language, sure, but the bigger point is simple: Orbit Culture aren\u2019t playing it safe or recycling an older version of themselves. They\u2019re trying to level up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re a riffs-first listener, that\u2019s why this band keeps grabbing attention. They\u2019re heavy, but they\u2019re not lazy. There are hooks, there\u2019s pacing, and there\u2019s a sense that the band actually cares about dynamics instead of just maxing out distortion and calling it \u201ccrushing.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Orbit Culture North American Tour Dates (with Ov Sulfur + Atlas)</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>2/18 \u2014 Roseville, CA \u2014 Goldfield Trading Post</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2/19 \u2014 Portland, OR \u2014 Star Theater</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2/20 \u2014 Seattle, WA \u2014 El Corazon</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2/22 \u2014 Vancouver, BC \u2014 Rickshaw Theater</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2/24 \u2014 Calgary, AB \u2014 Palace Theatre</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2/25 \u2014 Edmonton, AB \u2014 Midway Music Hall</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2/27 \u2014 Saskatoon, SK \u2014 Louis\u2019</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2/28 \u2014 Winnipeg, MB \u2014 Burton Cummings Theatre</li>\n\n\n\n<li>3/03 \u2014 Toronto, ON \u2014 Opera House</li>\n\n\n\n<li>3/05 \u2014 Montreal, QC \u2014 Beanfield Theatre</li>\n\n\n\n<li>3/06 \u2014 Ottawa, ON \u2014 The Bronson</li>\n\n\n\n<li>3/07 \u2014 Buffalo, NY \u2014 Electric City</li>\n\n\n\n<li>3/09 \u2014 Allentown, PA \u2014 Archer Music Hall</li>\n\n\n\n<li>3/10 \u2014 Silver Spring, MD \u2014 Fillmore Silver Spring</li>\n\n\n\n<li>3/11 \u2014 New York, NY \u2014 Gramercy Theater</li>\n\n\n\n<li>3/13 \u2014 New Haven, CT \u2014 Toad\u2019s</li>\n\n\n\n<li>3/14 \u2014 Worcester, MA \u2014 Palladium</li>\n\n\n\n<li>3/16 \u2014 Cleveland, OH \u2014 House of Blues Cleveland</li>\n\n\n\n<li>3/17 \u2014 Pittsburgh, PA \u2014 Preserving Underground</li>\n\n\n\n<li>3/18 \u2014 Chicago, IL \u2014 House of Blues Chicago</li>\n\n\n\n<li>3/20 \u2014 Milwaukee, WI \u2014 The Rave II</li>\n\n\n\n<li>3/21 \u2014 Detroit, MI \u2014 El Club</li>\n\n\n\n<li>3/23 \u2014 Lexington, KY \u2014 Manchester Music Hall</li>\n\n\n\n<li>3/24 \u2014 Atlanta, GA \u2014 Masquerade</li>\n\n\n\n<li>3/25 \u2014 Charlotte, NC \u2014 The Underground</li>\n\n\n\n<li>3/27 \u2014 Orlando, FL \u2014 House of Blues Orlando</li>\n\n\n\n<li>3/28 \u2014 St. Petersburg, FL \u2014 Jannus Live</li>\n\n\n\n<li>3/30 \u2014 Houston, TX \u2014 House of Blues</li>\n\n\n\n<li>3/31 \u2014 Dallas, TX \u2014 The Echo Lounge &amp; Music Hall</li>\n\n\n\n<li>4/01 \u2014 Oklahoma City, OK \u2014 Diamond Ballroom</li>\n\n\n\n<li>4/03 \u2014 Denver, CO \u2014 Gothic Theatre</li>\n\n\n\n<li>4/05 \u2014 Salt Lake City, UT \u2014 The Grand at The Complex</li>\n\n\n\n<li>4/06 \u2014 Las Vegas, NV \u2014 Brooklyn Bowl</li>\n\n\n\n<li>4/07 \u2014 Mesa, AZ \u2014 The Nile</li>\n\n\n\n<li>4/09 \u2014 Santa Ana, CA \u2014 The Observatory</li>\n\n\n\n<li>4/10 \u2014 Los Angeles, CA \u2014 Regent Theater</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tickets:</strong> <a href=\"https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3DOrbit%2520Culture\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Get Orbit Culture tickets (official listings)</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --\n\n<p><strong>Buy:</strong> <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4qGmvcy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Buy \u201cDeath Above Life\u201d on vinyl/CD</a></p>>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What\u2019s next</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Orbit Culture are also lined up for a heavy European festival summer (including Wacken and Bloodstock), and they\u2019re slated to join Amon Amarth and Soilwork later in the year on a separate run.

    "content": "\n<p>Monday is the cleanup day. The weekend doesn\u2019t always deliver one giant headline \u2014 it delivers a pile of smaller ones that add up to the same thing: the machine keeps moving. Here\u2019s what mattered, and what you can actually act on.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Quick Actions:</strong> <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tours/\">Browse active metal tours</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/amon-amarth-dethklok-tour/\">Amon Amarth + Dethklok dates</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/avatar-spring-2026-tour/\">Avatar spring 2026 tickets</a></p>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Nevermore Confirm 2026 Reunion Lineup, Sign With Reigning Phoenix Music, and Tease a New Album</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevermore are officially back in motion with a full lineup announcement and a label signing \u2014 which is a lot more meaningful than the usual \u201cnew chapter\u201d breadcrumb trail. Jeff Loomis and Van Williams are steering the reboot and they\u2019ve brought in vocalist Berzan Onen, guitarist Jack Cattoi, bassist Semir Ozerkan, plus a new album in the works. That last part is the real tell: this isn\u2019t just a nostalgia victory lap.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">LOUDNESS Announce 45th\u2011Anniversary Dates (U.S., Japan, and Europe)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>LOUDNESS are celebrating 45 years with a run that hits the U.S. first (including a stop at Hell\u2019s Heroes in Houston and a Whisky A Go Go date) before shifting into Japan and European festival appearances. If you\u2019ve somehow never seen them, this is one of those \u201cstop debating it\u201d tours \u2014 you don\u2019t get infinite chances with bands that helped build the lane in the first place.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">W.A.S.P. Announce \u201c1984 To Headless\u201d 2026 North American Tour With KK\u2019s Priest</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>W.A.S.P. are packaging this run around their first four albums \u2014 the era that made them infamous and untouchable in the theatrical hard rock world. The \u201c1984 To Headless\u201d tour runs September 10 through October 31, with KK\u2019s Priest as direct support. If you\u2019re going, don\u2019t overthink it. These kinds of nostalgia\u2011with\u2011teeth tours are exactly the ones people decide on late and then complain they missed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Avatar Cut Their London Show Short After Crew Members Were Shocked On an Electrified Stage</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Avatar pulled the plug early on their Valentine\u2019s Day London stop at Exhibition White City after an electrical issue turned the stage into a hazard. Johannes Eckerstr\u00f6m said the stage became electrified, damaged gear, and severely shocked two crew members \u2014 and the band deemed the venue unsafe to continue. That\u2019s the correct call. You don\u2019t gamble with people\u2019s safety so you can finish a setlist.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Castle Rat Add Two Headlining Shows Around the Amon Amarth + Dethklok Run</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Castle Rat are already on the big Amon Amarth + Dethklok tour, but they also added two standalone headliners: Grand Rapids (with Sacred Leather) and Anaheim (with Death Chant). The arena package is the spectacle. The headliners are where you catch a band while the room size is still human.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The HU + Apocalyptica Announce Spring 2026 U.S. Tour With The Rasmus</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a clean \u201cdifferent flavors, same punch\u201d bill: The HU\u2019s Hunnu rock energy, Apocalyptica\u2019s symphonic heaviness, and The Rasmus across the run. Dates start May 12 and wrap June 7 in Anaheim. If your city doesn\u2019t get weird pairings often, this is one of the better ones 2026 is offering.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Warped Tour 2026 Keeps Stacking Names</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Warped\u2019s rollout is doing what Warped always did: throw a ridiculous range of bands at the wall and let the crowd sort it out. Whether you love the genre whiplash or hate it, the lineup is big enough that most people will find something worth showing up for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More Metal Mantra:</strong> <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/\">Rundowns</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More from Metal Mantra:</strong> <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/\">Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026</a></p>\n",

The film was recorded during a sold-out show at the Ziggo Dome in Amsterdam, captured during the band&#8217;s massive 2023 European tour in support of <em>The War To End All Wars</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Where to watch:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.primevideo.com/detail/0JK8GKYLMM9QH0Q0FL5GRDWM1H/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon Prime Video</a> | <a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/movie/sabaton-the-tour-to-end-all-tours/umc.cmc.52mox4l4c649955joni3ye2gn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Apple TV</a> | <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=sabaton+the+tour+to+end+all+tours&#038;sp=EgIQBA%25253D%25253D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YouTube</a> (purchase/rental)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The setlist pulls from across Sabaton&#8217;s catalog, leaning heavy on the theatrical war-history anthems that pack arenas across Europe. Tracks from <em>The War To End All Wars</em> share space with long-standing live staples, and the Ziggo Dome production \u2014 pyro, LED walls, the full Sabaton stage rig \u2014 translates well to the screen. It&#8217;s not a stripped-down &#8220;we pointed a camera at the stage&#8221; situation. This is a proper concert film with multi-camera work and polished audio mixing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the band, the Amsterdam show carries personal weight. Sabaton has noted that their earliest Dutch shows drew a handful of people. Filming a sold-out Ziggo Dome \u2014 one of Europe&#8217;s premier indoor venues \u2014 for a global streaming release marks a &#8220;how it started vs. how it&#8217;s going&#8221; milestone that the film doesn&#8217;t shy away from acknowledging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The film originally had a limited theatrical run through Trafalgar Releasing before landing on streaming. If you missed it in cinemas, the home release loses nothing in translation \u2014 this is a loud, visually dense production built for big speakers and a dark room.

Vocalist Amanda Lyberg frames it as a fight with eating disorders, body dysmorphia, anxiety, and the kind of self-doubt that doesn\u2019t get quieter just because you\u2019re chasing a dream. In her words, it\u2019s about \u201chow dreams can become nightmares when the same people who once cheered for you are now criticizing you,\u201d and the song sits right in that uncomfortable space where confidence and collapse trade places hourly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lyberg doesn\u2019t play coy about it either: \u201cThe dream of being on stage comes with a spotlight on my personal flaws. I\u2019m just a body. To be picked apart and judged and perceived\u2026 Anxiety is a liar in my head. It tells me I\u2019m not good enough to be here. So, I fight it.\u201d That\u2019s the spine of \u201cMurder Scene\u201d \u2014 not a vague \u201cempowerment\u201d slogan, but the ugly, relentless loop you\u2019re trying to break.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019d rather go straight to the audio, you can stream/download \u201cMurder Scene\u201d here: <a href=\"https://evaunderfire.lnk.to/murderscene\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://evaunderfire.lnk.to/murderscene</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where this fits in the Eva Under Fire arc</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cMurder Scene\u201d is the follow-up to \u201cAwakening,\u201d the band\u2019s previous single that arrived in October and marked their first new music in a couple years. If \u201cAwakening\u201d was the door cracking open, \u201cMurder Scene\u201d is the band stepping through it with their shoulders squared \u2014 more direct, more personal, and more willing to let the cracks show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can catch up on Eva Under Fire <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3OaQ8p6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing that\u2019s easy to miss if you only see Eva Under Fire in headlines is that Lyberg isn\u2019t just writing about trauma \u2014 she\u2019s worked with it. She\u2019s a practicing psychotherapist (trauma, grief/loss, addiction recovery), and you can feel that perspective in how these songs avoid the usual rock-script shortcuts. \u201cMurder Scene\u201d doesn\u2019t posture \u2014 it documents the fight.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2026 Tour Dates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Eva Under Fire are taking \u201cMurder Scene\u201d to the stage immediately, joining Jeris Johnson and Butcher Babies for a U.S. run starting February 8 in Portland.

    "content": "\n<p><a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/knocked-loose/\">Knocked\nLoose</a> have never been a band that \u201ctries something\u201d just to prove\nthey can. Every pivot they\u2019ve made since <em>Laugh Tracks</em> has\nfelt like the next logical escalation: tighter writing, uglier tones,\nmore negative space, and an even sharper sense for when to cut the\nfloor out from under you. \u201cHive Mind\u201d keeps that trajectory intact \u2014\nand the Denzel Curry feature doesn\u2019t read like a label brainstorm or a\ncrossover-for-clicks move. It reads like two worlds that have been\norbiting the same aggression for years finally deciding to\ncollide. More reviews: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/review/\">Review hub</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Sound and the Impact</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Musically, \u201cHive Mind\u201d hits like modern Knocked Loose should:\nblunt-force riffs, a drum sound that feels like it\u2019s breaking the room\ninto smaller rooms, and those trademark stop-start dynamics are where\nthe band weaponizes silence as much as sound. The opening doesn\u2019t\nwaste time with scene-courting atmosphere or \u201clet\u2019s build to the\nheavy.\u201d It\u2019s heavy immediately \u2014 not in the cartoonish \u201cheaviest thing\never\u201d marketing way, but in the real sense that the guitar tone is\nabrasive, the rhythm locks into that stomping, punitive pocket, and\neverything around it exists to make the next impact land harder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Garris remains one of the best frontmen in heavy music at making\nurgency feel physical. His delivery is still that serrated bark, but\nwhat makes it work is the phrasing: he doesn\u2019t just ride the riff, he\nargues with it. The words feel shoved out of him, like the band is\ndragging him forward by the throat. That\u2019s always been the Knocked\nLoose advantage \u2014 the songs aren\u2019t just \u201cangry,\u201d they\u2019re\n<em>activated</em>. You can hear it in how he paces lines against the\ngroove and how the band will pull back just enough to spotlight a\nhook, then slam the door.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why the Feature Works (And Why It Doesn\u2019t\nFeel Forced)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Denzel Curry part is where this could\u2019ve gone sideways, and it\ndoesn\u2019t. The secret is that Curry doesn\u2019t show up to cosplay hardcore.\nHe shows up like Denzel Curry: percussive, rhythmic, and fast enough\nto ride a beat that\u2019s basically trying to throw him off. That\u2019s the\ndifference \u2014 he\u2019s not treating the feature like a novelty cameo. It\u2019s\na performance that\u2019s clearly written to <em>fit</em> the track\u2019s\ntension.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crossover features in heavy music usually fail for one of two\nreasons: either the guest sounds like they\u2019re pasted on top of a\nbacking track, or the band sands their own edges down to accommodate\nthe guest. \u201cHive Mind\u201d avoids both. Knocked Loose doesn\u2019t soften the\nmusic to create a \u201crap-friendly\u201d moment; the band stays ugly and\nphysical. Curry, meanwhile, finds his lane inside that ugliness and\nmakes it feel natural \u2014 like the song had space carved out for him\nwithout losing any pressure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What \u201cHive Mind\u201d does best is remind you that the\nmetal/hardcore/rap Venn diagram isn\u2019t theoretical anymore. It\u2019s how a\nlot of people actually listen. If you grew up on breakdowns\n<em>and</em> blast-your-car-subwoofers rap, this track doesn\u2019t feel\nlike a fusion experiment. It feels like a statement of the obvious:\nintensity is intensity, and the only thing that matters is whether\nit\u2019s convincing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Video: Real Places, Real Grit</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The video is the right setting for Knocked Loose\u2019s brand of\nclaustrophobic violence. They\u2019ve always felt like a band that belongs\nin real places \u2014 basements, VFW halls, skate spots \u2014 not sterile\n\u201cperformance clip\u201d sets that try to make heaviness look expensive.\nThere\u2019s a grit to that choice that matches their whole ethos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zooming out: \u201cHive Mind\u201d also lands as a smart next step after\n2024\u2019s <em>You Won\u2019t Go Before You\u2019re Supposed To</em>. That record\nwidened their spotlight without turning them into a different band,\nand a feature like this capitalizes on that momentum without feeling\nlike a surrender to it. If anything, it\u2019s a flex: we\u2019re bigger now,\nand we\u2019re using that reach to make heavier swings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there\u2019s a knock against \u201cHive Mind,\u201d it\u2019s that Knocked Loose are\nnow so consistent at delivering this level of controlled brutality\nthat the shock factor isn\u2019t what it was when they first started\npushing their sound into more jagged territory. But that\u2019s not a real\nproblem \u2014 it\u2019s what happens when you become the benchmark. The real\nquestion is whether the song sticks, and between the pacing, the\nfeature, and the inherent replay value of that rhythmic violence, this\none has legs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Final Take</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> \u201cHive Mind\u201d is a legit collaboration, not\na marketing stunt \u2014 and it keeps Knocked Loose right where they\u2019ve\nbeen living: at the front of modern heavy music, dragging the rest of\nthe scene forward by sheer force.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Knocked Loose &quot;Hive Mind&quot; (ft.

From Bruce Dickinson&#8217;s analog recording sessions with Sepultura members at Dave Grohl&#8217;s legendary Studio 606 to a stacked summer metalcore package tearing through the United States, today&#8217;s developments prove the heavy music ecosystem remains as active and globe-spanning as ever, with established legends and rising forces alike commanding attention across multiple territories and subgenres. Catch more in the <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/\">latest Rundown</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p> <strong>Bruce Dickinson</strong> is currently deep in the tracking process for his next solo album at Dave Grohl&#8217;s renowned Studio 606, working alongside members of Sepultura and capturing performances live in the room using traditional analog methods that prioritize organic energy over digital precision. Once the recording wraps, the Iron Maiden vocalist will rejoin his legendary band for the massive 2026 &#8220;Run For Your Lives&#8221; tour, which will see the metal institution storming through Europe and the Americas with what promises to be one of the year&#8217;s most ambitious heavy music productions.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p> <strong>Fear Factory</strong> has confirmed a May 2026 tour across Australia and New Zealand, finally bringing their mechanized, groove-laden industrial metal assault to the Southern Hemisphere with confirmed stops in Perth, Adelaide, and additional cities throughout both countries. This marks a significant moment for the revitalized outfit, as their punishing blend of mechanical precision and crushing heaviness will reach fans who have waited years for the band to make the journey Down Under, cementing Fear Factory&#8217;s commitment to global touring despite past internal turbulence.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p> <strong>Mastodon</strong> just unveiled a comprehensive European tour scheduled for summer 2026, with rising British metalcore act Loathe confirmed as direct support across multiple countries throughout the run. The Atlanta sludge metal titans will flex their progressive muscle and technical prowess across the continent, delivering their signature blend of complex arrangements and crushing riffs to audiences from Scandinavia to Southern Europe in what stands as one of the season&#8217;s most anticipated heavy music pairings.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p> <strong>Motionless In White</strong> dropped a bombshell summer tour announcement featuring a stacked bill that includes deathcore powerhouse Lorna Shore, metalcore mainstays Fit For A King, and rising UK post-hardcore outfit Static Dress, creating what may be the most potent metalcore package of the 2026 touring season. The multi-city United States run will showcase the full spectrum of modern heavy music, from theatrical gothic metal to technical brutality, giving fans across the country a comprehensive look at the current state of metalcore&#8217;s evolution and commercial reach,</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p> <strong>Poison the Well</strong> is making the journey to Australia this June, bringing their influential blend of metallic hardcore and emotional intensity to the continent with support from local act Haywire on select dates. The Florida legends, who helped define the intersection of hardcore aggression and melodic sensibility in the early 2000s, will fly the flag for American metalcore internationally, proving their continued relevance and drawing power nearly three decades into their career.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p> <strong>Maul</strong> announced a headlining United States tour scheduled for March 2026, bringing their punishing death metal barrage to cities spanning from Wisconsin through Texas and hitting multiple regions in between. The North Dakota death metal outfit continues building momentum behind their crushing riff-driven approach, demonstrating that underground extreme metal still commands dedicated audiences willing to pack venues for uncompromising brutality delivered with technical precision and old-school intensity.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p> <strong>New Music Releases</strong> flooded the zone over the past 48 hours, with Transilvania unleashing &#8220;Set The Tombs On Fire&#8221; alongside accompanying visual content, while Cyclone, Tailgunner, and Sister Sin also dropped fresh singles and music videos that span multiple subgenres from traditional heavy metal to modern aggression. This simultaneous release barrage demonstrates the constant content flow that defines contemporary metal culture, where established acts and emerging forces alike maintain visibility through regular single drops and visual media that keep fans engaged between album cycles and tour announcements.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p> <strong>Blaze Bayley</strong> made the difficult but necessary decision to permanently eliminate traditional meet-and-greet sessions from his touring schedule, prioritizing his long-term health and recovery following a serious cardiac event that required immediate medical intervention. The former Iron Maiden vocalist will continue performing live shows and connecting with audiences through his music, but the physical and time demands of post-show autograph sessions and extended fan interactions have been removed from his professional obligations, reflecting a growing awareness among aging metal musicians about sustainable career management and the importance of health maintenance over fan service expectations.</p>\n\n\n<p>More from this cycle: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/iron-maiden-2026-run-for-your-lives-tour/\">Iron Maiden 2026 tour coverage</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tours/\">Metal Tours &amp; Tickets Hub</a></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>More from Metal Mantra:</strong> <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/\">Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/iron-maiden-discography-legacy/\">Iron Maiden Discography &#038; Legacy</a></p>\n",

    "content": "<p><strong>Rock for People</strong> just loaded up their special <a href=\"/tag/iron-maiden/\">Iron Maiden</a> day with enough firepower to justify the hype. <a href=\"/tag/knocked-loose/\">Knocked Loose</a>, <strong>Saxon</strong>, <strong>Alexisonfire</strong>, and <strong>Man With A Mission</strong> are all confirmed for Sunday, June 14, 2026 \u2014 the fifth and final day of the <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/rock-for-people-2026-announces-massive-lineup-featuring-iron-maiden-bring-me-the-horizon-papa-roach-electric-callboy-2/\">Czech festival</a> that&#8217;s become one of Europe&#8217;s better-curated hard music gatherings at Park 360 in Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9. We&#8217;ll keep updates rolling in our <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/rock-for-people-2026/\">Rock for People 2026 coverage</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://rockforpeople.cz/en/tickets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Buy Rock for People 2026 passes now</a> (capacity is moving fast).</p>\n\n\n<p>This isn&#8217;t just padding around a headliner. Saxon brings legitimate NWOBHM pedigree \u2014 these guys were charting when most of us weren&#8217;t born, with classics like &#8220;Wheels of Steel&#8221; and &#8220;Denim and Leather&#8221; defining early 80s metal. If you want to revisit the classics before the festival, grab <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3NXPkDS\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://amzn.to/3NXPkDS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Saxon&#8217;s Wheels of Steel</a> on vinyl. Their 50-year career proves they&#8217;ve earned their spot on any bill with Maiden.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Knocked Loose represents everything heavy that matters right now. That Grammy nomination for Best Metal Performance proved hardcore finally broke through the mainstream&#8217;s bullshit gate, and their chaotic live shows have been obliterating festivals worldwide. We just covered their absolute destruction at ShipRocked 2026, where they turned the cruise into a floating mosh pit \u2014 <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/shiprocked-2026-review-metal-cruise-dead-poet-society-knocked-loose/\">read our full cruise review here</a> to see what Rock for People is in for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alexisonfire brings that mid-2000s post-hardcore energy that still resonates. The Canadian quintet&#8217;s combination of screamo intensity and melodic hooks influenced an entire generation of bands, and their recent reunion shows they haven&#8217;t lost a step. Man With A Mission rounds out the bill with their anime-inspired rock theatrics \u2014 they&#8217;re genuinely fun in a scene that takes itself too seriously sometimes, and their return after Rock for People 2023 shows the festival knows what works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Festival director Lud\u011bk Moty\u010dka says they built a &#8220;dramaturgically thought-out day&#8221; \u2014 which is just fancy talk for saying they actually gave a shit about booking bands that make sense together. It shows. You&#8217;re getting metal legends alongside the bands reshaping heavy music in 2026, all building toward Maiden&#8217;s inevitable two-hour assault.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Iron Maiden Day Caps a Stacked Five-Day Festival</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Maiden-anchored Sunday isn&#8217;t happening in a vacuum. Rock for People 2026 runs June 10-14 with one of the most eclectic lineups the Czech festival has ever assembled. Wednesday kicks off with <strong>Gorillaz</strong>, <strong>Electric Callboy</strong>, <a href=\"/tag/megadeth/\">Megadeth</a>, and <strong>Trivium</strong>. Thursday brings <a href=\"/tag/limp-bizkit/\">Limp Bizkit</a>, <strong>Papa Roach</strong>, and <strong>BABYMETAL</strong>. Friday sees <a href=\"/tag/bring-me-the-horizon/\">Bring Me The Horizon</a> headline alongside <strong>A Day To Remember</strong> and <strong>Tom Morello</strong>. Saturday closes with <strong>Halsey</strong>, <strong>Within Temptation</strong>, and <strong>Nothing But Thieves</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s the kind of booking strategy that works because they&#8217;re not trying to be Download or Wacken \u2014 Rock for People has always lived in the space where rock, metal, and alternative overlap without apology. The festival has built its reputation over two decades by taking chances on diverse lineups that somehow make perfect sense when you&#8217;re actually there. The Maiden day just takes that philosophy and dials it to eleven with a focused heavy music lineup that actually respects the headliner&#8217;s legacy instead of throwing random acts on the bill.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Grandstands, Beer, and Selling Out Fast</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://rockforpeople.cz/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rock for People</a> is adding seated grandstands at the main stage for 490 CZK (about $21 USD) as a ticket upgrade to any festival pass. Not a bad call if you want guaranteed sightlines for Maiden&#8217;s two-hour set without fighting for barrier position all day. The grandstand setup is new for 2026, addressing one of the few complaints about the festival&#8217;s otherwise excellent facilities at Park 360.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to prep for the show? <a href=\"https://amzn.to/46AqBf3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Pick up some Iron Maiden vinyl</a> before you head to Prague. Die-hards can also hit up an Iron Maiden Trooper beer tasting and special wine experience, because apparently Bruce Dickinson&#8217;s beverage empire is taking over the festival grounds. Honestly, if you&#8217;re going to get hammered at a metal festival, might as well do it with the headliner&#8217;s branded alcohol.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tickets are moving fast</strong> \u2014 over 80% of capacity is already gone, which is unusual for February. The Iron Maiden announcement clearly lit a fire under ticket sales. If you&#8217;re planning to make the trip to Park 360 in Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9, Czechia, grab tickets <a href=\"https://rockforpeople.cz/en/tickets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">directly from Rock for People</a> before this thing sells out completely. Multi-day passes start around $345, with single-day tickets for the Iron Maiden Sunday expected to be announced soon.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"819\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/d442c62c-0fb5-4ce3-9967-6f3398ef5281-819x1024.png\" alt=\"Rock for People 2026 festival poster highlighting Iron Maiden as the headliner on Sunday June 14, with supporting acts including Alexisonfire, Alter Bridge, Knocked Loose, Queensr\u00ffche, and Saxon, set in bold red, black, and yellow graphic design.\" class=\"wp-image-3544\" srcset=\"https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/d442c62c-0fb5-4ce3-9967-6f3398ef5281-819x1024.png 819w, https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/d442c62c-0fb5-4ce3-9967-6f3398ef5281-240x300.png 240w, https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/d442c62c-0fb5-4ce3-9967-6f3398ef5281-768x960.png 768w, https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/d442c62c-0fb5-4ce3-9967-6f3398ef5281.png 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Fan Extras</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3NXPkDS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Saxon \u2013 Wheels of Steel (vinyl)</a> | <a href=\"https://amzn.to/46AqBf3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Iron Maiden vinyl picks</a></p>\n\n\n<p>Related: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/knocked-loose-denzel-curry-hive-mind/\">Knocked Loose Feat.

    "title": "ShipRocked 2026 Review: Six Days of Metal Chaos at Sea",
    "content": "\n<p>I just spent six days on the Carnival Horizon with some of the heaviest bands in modern metal, and I&#8217;m still processing what the hell just happened. We&#8217;ll keep updates rolling in our <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/shiprocked/\">ShipRocked coverage</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was my third <a href=\"https://www.shiprocked.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ShipRocked</a>\u2014Triple Threat status, for those keeping track\u2014but it was my first time covering it as <strong>Metal Mantra</strong>. The first two times, I was just another metalhead on the ship, soaking it all in. This year? I brought you all with me, and ShipRocked 2026 delivered in ways I wasn&#8217;t expecting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lineup was stacked: Knocked Loose, Halestorm, Motionless In White, Wage War, Avatar, and dozens more across six days at sea. But here&#8217;s what no press release will tell you\u2014ShipRocked isn&#8217;t just about the bands. It&#8217;s about being trapped on a floating metal festival with nowhere to escape, where the band you just watched destroys a stage set wanders over to watch the next act right next to you. It&#8217;s chaos, community, and catharsis all at once.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Performances That Mattered</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"/tag/dead-poet-society/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Dead Poet Society</a> owned this cruise.</strong> They played two sets\u2014one in the ship&#8217;s theater and one on the Lido Deck\u2014and both were absolutely flawless. Jack Underkofler has the best voice I heard all week, and that&#8217;s saying something when you&#8217;re sharing a boat with some of the biggest names in modern metal. The theater set had that intimate, dialed-in energy where every note hit perfectly. The deck set brought the chaos. Between setlist choices, stage presence, and sound quality, DPS was firing on all cylinders. If you slept on them, you missed out. <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4two6Vc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Check out their latest album on vinyl</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"/tag/house-of-protection/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">House of Protection</a> brought pure, unfiltered chaos</strong> to the Lido Deck in the best way possible. Their set was messy, fun, and exactly what an outdoor metal cruise performance should be. No pretense, just raw energy and a crowd that fed off it. These are the kind of sets that make ShipRocked special\u2014bands that understand the assignment and lean into the absurdity of playing heavy music on a cruise ship.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"/tag/wage-war/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Wage War</a>&#8216;s opening night set was a cathartic release.</strong> They came out swinging on the first night and reminded everyone why they&#8217;re one of the best live <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/metalcore/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">metalcore</a> acts right now. Tight, heavy, and emotionally charged. The set built the energy that would define the rest of the week, and Wage War delivered exactly what the crowd needed to kick things off right. Catch them on tour\u2014grab tickets here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"/tag/knocked-loose/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Knocked Loose</a> tried to sink the boat.</strong> I&#8217;m not exaggerating. You&#8217;re technically not allowed to mosh or crowd surf on ShipRocked for safety reasons, and that rule lasted approximately five minutes into Knocked Loose&#8217;s first set before the entire front section erupted. I was on the rail for this one, and Shield Security deserves an award for catching surfer after surfer while somehow keeping everyone safe and smiling. The crowd was the most insane I&#8217;ve seen in three years of ShipRocked. Bryan Garris and the crew knew exactly what they were doing, and they did it anyway. Respect. <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Zgx2jC\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Grab their latest album here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"/tag/the-funeral-portrait/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Funeral Portrait</a></strong> might have been my favorite surprise of the cruise. You could tell being on ShipRocked meant everything to them. Lee Jennings was everywhere\u2014taking photos, talking to fans, genuinely having the time of his life\u2014and that energy came through in their performances. When a band is that visibly stoked to be there, the crowd feels it. Their sets were proof that ShipRocked isn&#8217;t just about the biggest names on the lineup; it&#8217;s about bands that understand what this experience means to the metal community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"/tag/holy-wars/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Holy Wars</a> stepped up huge.</strong> I&#8217;d seen them before, so maybe I should have expected it, but they raised their game on this cruise. They were a massive standout, and they spent an absurd amount of time talking to me and my travel partner between sets. Every time I ran into them after that, they&#8217;d stop to say what&#8217;s up or throw a smile. That&#8217;s the ShipRocked difference\u2014the bands are accessible in ways they never are at land festivals.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Moments Between the Chaos</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Karaoke is always a ShipRocked highlight, and this year didn&#8217;t disappoint. Eric Vanlerberghe from I Prevail singing karaoke at 3 in the morning is exactly the kind of moment that only happens on a metal cruise. No stage, no production, just a dude from one of the biggest metalcore bands having fun with the crowd.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there was <strong>The Stowaways</strong>\u2014an all-star cover band made up of musicians from other acts on the lineup\u2014who had both their sets scheduled for the Lido Deck. Friday night&#8217;s second performance got cancelled due to a storm rolling in, but the show must go on. The entire crew and tech staff busted their asses to get the Ocean Plaza stage ready in record time, making sure the music didn&#8217;t stop just because Mother Nature had other plans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/punksgitcut/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Jay Howell</a></strong> deserves his own paragraph. The animator and character designer behind Nickelodeon&#8217;s <em>Sanjay and Craig</em> and Fox&#8217;s <em>Bob&#8217;s Burgers</em> was doing free portrait sessions on the ship, and once people realized who he was and what he was doing, the line became insane. He stayed late every single session to make sure as many people as possible got their portraits done. I got mine done in the first session, and he still remembered me from previous festivals when I ran into him later. Super nice, super personable, and a genuine superhero for committing that much time to fans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AWOLNATION was one of the most talked-about acts on the boat. A lot of people had never heard of them or were surprised to see them on a metal cruise lineup, but they won over the crowd. That&#8217;s the beauty of ShipRocked&#8217;s eclectic lineups\u2014you discover bands you wouldn&#8217;t have given a chance otherwise.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Ship, The Vibe, The Logistics</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This was ShipRocked&#8217;s first time on the <a href=\"https://www.carnival.com/cruise-ships/carnival-horizon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Carnival Horizon</a>, and there were some growing pains. The layout is different from previous ships, and things felt more spread out. The casino and bar areas\u2014which were the natural congregation points on past cruises\u2014didn&#8217;t have the same centralized energy this year. Instead, people formed smaller groups scattered around the ship. It wasn&#8217;t bad, just different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For first-timers (or &#8220;Newbs&#8221; as we call them), the vibe was still incredible. There were just fewer spontaneous crowd moments in the common areas compared to previous years. I also noticed fewer visible artist interactions, but I think that&#8217;s more about the ship&#8217;s layout making it harder to stumble into bands rather than the artists being less present. They were definitely around\u2014you just had to know where to look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sets started later than I remember from previous years, and there were a few logistical hiccups that felt like new-ship stress. Nothing catastrophic, but noticeable if you&#8217;ve been on ShipRocked before. The Knocked Loose crowd-surfing chaos tested the limits of what the ship could handle, but Shield Security and the crew managed it without incident. Props to them for keeping it safe without killing the energy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Between sets? Bring on the food and booze. I ate an unreasonable amount of Guy&#8217;s Burgers, drank way too much Zeus Juice and Splash of the Titans, and hit up the steakhouse for an absurdly cheap price compared to what you&#8217;d pay on land. And then there was the 4am pizza\u2014legitimately some of the best slices I&#8217;ve had, not just &#8220;good for cruise ship food&#8221; but actually good pizza. The food on this cruise was legitimately solid, which is not something you always hear about cruise ships.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why ShipRocked Hits Different</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s what you won&#8217;t get from <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/category/live/festival-reviews/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">festival recaps</a> or press releases: <strong>ShipRocked is a vacation like no other.</strong> If you love heavy music, this is mecca. You&#8217;re not just attending a festival\u2014you&#8217;re living with the bands, the crew, and thousands of other metalheads for six straight days. There&#8217;s no going home at the end of the night. There&#8217;s no missing a set because you had to leave early. You&#8217;re committed, and so is everyone else on that ship.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The community aspect is what makes ShipRocked irreplaceable. We&#8217;re family, not just for a week but for life. I keep in contact with hundreds of ShipRocked friends year-round. We meet up at other shows and festivals. We plan trips together. The bonds you form on that ship are real because you&#8217;re all living the same experience together\u2014no outside distractions, no escape routes, just six days of heavy music and shared chaos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And here&#8217;s the thing that separates ShipRocked from every other <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/festivals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">festival</a>: <strong>when the &#8220;rockstar&#8221; finishes their set, they wander over to watch the next band right next to you.</strong> Nowhere else does that happen. At land festivals, the bands are in VIP areas or tour buses or already on the road to the next city. On ShipRocked, they&#8217;re stuck on the boat with you. They&#8217;re at the bars, the pool deck, the karaoke sessions. They&#8217;re fans of the other bands too, and they&#8217;re living the same experience you are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there were disappointments, they were personal and not lineup-specific. Some people wanted heavier bands, some wanted more variety. That&#8217;s always going to happen with any festival. But the lineup delivered on what ShipRocked promises: an eclectic mix of modern metal, metalcore, deathcore, and hard rock with enough variety to keep six days interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>ShipRocked isn&#8217;t cheap, and it&#8217;s not convenient. You&#8217;re committing to six days with no escape route, no early exits, and no plan B if the lineup doesn&#8217;t hit the way you hoped. But here&#8217;s the thing: that all-in commitment is exactly why it works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every land festival I&#8217;ve been to ends the same way\u2014everyone scatters at the end of the weekend, you drive home exhausted, and by Monday it feels like it never happened. ShipRocked doesn&#8217;t let you off that easy. You&#8217;re locked in, and so is everyone else. The bands can&#8217;t leave. The crowd can&#8217;t thin out. You&#8217;re all stuck together, and that forced proximity creates something you can&#8217;t replicate anywhere else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was my first time covering ShipRocked as <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/\">Metal Mantra</a>, and it gave me a completely different lens on the experience. Watching Dead Poet Society nail two flawless sets, seeing Knocked Loose turn the Lido Deck into a mosh pit that shouldn&#8217;t have been physically possible, catching The Funeral Portrait at their most genuine\u2014these aren&#8217;t just performances. They&#8217;re proof that when you remove the escape routes and force everyone to be present, the music hits harder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve been on the fence about booking ShipRocked, here&#8217;s what you need to understand: this isn&#8217;t a festival you can half-ass. You can&#8217;t show up for a day, catch your favorite band, and leave. You&#8217;re either all in or you&#8217;re not there at all. And if you&#8217;re all in? You&#8217;ll understand why people keep coming back year after year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One more thing:&nbsp;<strong>don&#8217;t wait.</strong>&nbsp;ShipRocked sells out every single year. The waitlist gets long, and watching cabin availability disappear while you&#8217;re still deciding is brutal. If you know you want to go, book the second cabins drop. Hesitation costs you a spot on the boat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ShipRocked 2027 is already locked in: January 24-30, departing from Miami and hitting Mahogany Bay in Roatan, Honduras, and Cozumel, Mexico. I&#8217;ll be booking the second tickets go live. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>See you on the boat in 2027. \ud83e\udd18</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>More ShipRocked Coverage: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/shiprocked-2027-jan-24-30-cruise-announced-after-sold-out-2026/\">ShipRocked 2027: Jan. 24\u201330 Cruise Announced After Sold-Out 2026</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/metal-mantra-shiprocked-2026-editorial/\">Metal Mantra Sets Sail: Why Shiprocked 2026 Is the Metal Festival Experience You Can\u2019t Replicate on Land</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/shiprocked-2026-cruise-details-lineup-2/\">Shiprocked 2026 Cruise Details &#038; Lineup</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>More Metal Mantra: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tours/\">Metal Tours</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/\">Rundowns</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More from Metal Mantra:</strong> <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/\">Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026</a></p>\n",

    "content": "\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Metal &amp; Hard Rock News \u2013 February 3, 2026: Grammy Milestones, Major Tour Announcements, and Triumphant Returns</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The heavy music landscape delivered a compelling mix of historic achievements and significant touring news today, with Grammy recognition for hardcore-influenced metal, chart-topping milestones for thrash legends, and multiple major tour announcements that promise to dominate the summer concert calendar. From award show validation to long-awaited comebacks, February 3 brings developments that span the full spectrum of metal and hard rock subgenres, demonstrating the continued vitality and evolution of heavy music across both mainstream and underground channels. Catch more in the <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/\">latest Rundown</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p> <strong>Turnstile</strong> made Grammy history at the 68th Annual Grammy Awards on February 1, taking home the trophy for Best Metal Performance with their track &#8220;Birds&#8221; in a win that represents a significant moment for hardcore-influenced metal in mainstream award ceremonies and validates the Baltimore band&#8217;s crossover success that has seen them bridge punk, hardcore, and metal audiences while earning critical acclaim and festival headlining slots across multiple continents. The victory demonstrates that the boundaries between heavy music subgenres continue to blur in ways that benefit artists willing to push sonic boundaries beyond traditional categorizations, and the Recording Academy&#8217;s recognition of Turnstile&#8217;s experimental approach signals a potential shift in how mainstream institutions evaluate and celebrate heavy music that incorporates elements from multiple underground traditions rather than adhering strictly to established metal conventions.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p> <strong>Megadeth</strong> achieved a career-defining milestone by claiming their first-ever No. 1 position on the Billboard 200 chart after releasing 17 studio albums across more than four decades of existence, a testament to both the band&#8217;s enduring relevance and the dedicated fanbase that has supported thrash metal&#8217;s pioneers through lineup changes, industry shifts, and evolving musical landscapes that have seen countless contemporary acts rise and fall. The chart-topping achievement comes as validation for Dave Mustaine and company, who have consistently delivered critically acclaimed albums and maintained a rigorous touring schedule while never quite reaching the commercial peak that has now finally arrived, proving that longevity and artistic integrity can eventually translate into mainstream chart dominance even in an era dominated by streaming metrics and algorithmic playlists that often favor viral moments over sustained artistic excellence.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p> <strong>Godsmack</strong> unveiled &#8220;The Rise of Rock World Tour,&#8221; a major touring package that pairs the Boston hard rock veterans with Stone Temple Pilots and Dorothy as supporting acts, creating a multi-generational lineup that spans grunge revival, alternative metal, and contemporary blues-infused hard rock in a package clearly designed to maximize audience appeal across demographic segments. The announcement represents a significant touring investment for Godsmack, who continue to draw substantial audiences despite the challenges facing rock radio and the evolution of how fans discover and consume heavy music, while the inclusion of Stone Temple Pilots adds nostalgic appeal for fans who remember the 1990s alternative rock explosion and Dorothy brings a fresh perspective that connects the package to contemporary hard rock audiences who may be discovering these legacy acts for the first time through streaming platforms and festival appearances.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p> <strong>Omnium Gatherum</strong> vocalist Jukka Pelkonen received a lymphoma diagnosis that will force him to miss the Finnish melodic death metal band&#8217;s upcoming European tour dates, a development that underscores the personal sacrifices and health challenges that touring musicians face while also highlighting the metal community&#8217;s tendency to rally around artists during medical crises with overwhelming support and solidarity. The band has not yet announced whether they will postpone tour dates, recruit a temporary replacement vocalist, or cancel the run entirely, though the melodic death metal scene has historically shown flexibility in accommodating lineup changes when health issues arise, and fans have expressed overwhelming support for Pelkonen&#8217;s recovery and treatment process through social media channels and fan forums that demonstrate the close-knit nature of the European extreme metal community.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p> <strong>Oranssi Pazuzu</strong> announced their first North American tour in seven years, bringing their psychedelic black metal experimentation back to U.S. and Canadian venues with Wayfarer serving as support in a pairing that promises to deliver atmospheric and challenging performances for audiences seeking music that pushes beyond traditional metal boundaries into cosmic horror and progressive territory. The Finnish experimental collective has built a reputation for mind-bending live performances that translate their studio albums&#8217; otherworldly soundscapes and progressive structures into immersive concert experiences that often leave audiences questioning the conventional definitions of black metal, while their extended absence from North American stages has only intensified anticipation among fans of avant-garde metal who have watched the band&#8217;s profile rise steadily through festival appearances and critical acclaim in European markets where experimental approaches to extreme metal have found particularly receptive audiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p> <strong>Sister Sin</strong> returned from a 12-year recording hiatus with &#8220;Suicide Hill,&#8221; released digitally on February 3, marking the Swedish traditional heavy metal band&#8217;s first new music since their 2014 album and signaling a potential full-scale comeback for a group that built a devoted following through relentless touring and old-school metal craftsmanship that honored the classic sounds of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal while adding contemporary production values and energy. The new single arrives without advance warning or extensive promotional buildup, suggesting either a testing-the-waters approach to gauge fan interest or a confidence that their established fanbase remains engaged despite the lengthy absence, and early reactions on streaming platforms and metal forums indicate strong enthusiasm for hearing vocalist Liv Jagrell&#8217;s powerful voice and the band&#8217;s classic metal approach in a contemporary context that has seen renewed interest in traditional heavy metal sounds and aesthetics among younger listeners discovering the genre&#8217;s foundational elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p> <strong>Spiritbox</strong> performed &#8220;Soft Spine&#8221; during the Grammy Awards pre-show ceremony on February 1, delivering a high-profile performance opportunity even though the Canadian progressive metalcore band did not win the Best Metal Performance category that ultimately went to Turnstile in what many observers considered a competitive field representing diverse approaches to contemporary heavy music. The Grammy appearance represents significant mainstream exposure for Spiritbox, whose blend of djent-influenced heaviness, electronic elements, and Courtney LaPlante&#8217;s dynamic vocal range has made them one of modern metal&#8217;s most discussed acts, and their inclusion in Grammy festivities\u2014regardless of the competitive outcome\u2014demonstrates the Recording Academy&#8217;s expanding recognition of diverse heavy music styles beyond traditional metal categories that have historically dominated the awards&#8217; limited heavy music recognition and often overlooked progressive or experimental approaches to the genre.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p> <strong>Rob Zombie and Marilyn Manson</strong> announced a reunion tour that will see the shock rock icons co-headline 21 North American dates throughout summer 2026, with Mongolian folk metal sensation The Hu and industrial rock veterans Orgy filling out a package designed to maximize nostalgic appeal while introducing diverse sonic elements that span traditional theatrical metal, international folk influences, and late-1990s industrial aesthetics. The tour marks another collaboration between Zombie and Manson, who have previously joined forces for successful touring packages that capitalize on their shared theatrical approach to heavy music and controversial public personas that made them cultural lightning rods during the height of their mainstream popularity, while the inclusion of The Hu adds an unexpected international dimension that has proven commercially successful for the Mongolian act and Orgy provides a connection to the industrial metal movement that rounds out a lineup clearly designed to appeal to multiple generations of alternative metal fans who remember when these artists dominated MTV rotation and rock radio programming.</p>\n\n\n<p>Tour watch: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/evanescence-2026-world-tour/\">Evanescence 2026 World Tour</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tours/\">Metal Tours &amp; Tickets Hub</a></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>More from Metal Mantra:</strong> <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/\">Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-metal-tracks-of-2025/\">Top 10 Metal Tracks of 2025</a></p>\n",

Brazilian thrash/groove metal titans Sepultura have announced the final North American leg of their &#8220;Celebrating Life Through Death&#8221; farewell tour, and the support lineup is nothing short of legendary. Bay Area thrash icons <a href=\"/tag/exodus\">Exodus</a>, hardcore heavyweights Biohazard, and Texas death metal destroyers Tribal Gaze will join the farewell trek that kicks off April 29th in Montclair, NJ and wraps May 29th at The Wiltern in Los Angeles. Originally launched in March 2024, the farewell tour was extended due to overwhelming demand and will now run through late 2026, giving fans around the world one last chance to witness the band that helped put South American metal on the global map. The tour hits major markets including Detroit, Atlanta, New Orleans, Chicago, Las Vegas, and San Diego, plus festival stops at Welcome to Rockville and Sonic Temple. After nearly 40 years and 15 studio albums, Sepultura&#8217;s influence on groove metal, thrash, and death metal cannot be overstated. Biohazard vocalist Billy Graziadei summed it up perfectly: &#8220;Hitting the road with Sepultura and Exodus is gonna be pure chaos and adrenaline.&#8221; General on-sale is this Friday, January 23rd at 10 AM local time, with VIP packages available now. This is your last chance to witness one of metal&#8217;s most influential bands\u2014don&#8217;t miss it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Stay heavy, stay loud, and we&#8217;ll see you in the pit.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>For more metal news January 2026 updates, tour announcements, and album releases, bookmark Metal Mantra and follow us on social media.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\"/>\n\n\n<p>More Metal Mantra: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/\">Rundowns</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tours/\">Metal Tours</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More from Metal Mantra:</strong> <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/\">Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/welcome-to-rockville-2026/\">Welcome to Rockville 2026</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/sonic-temple-2026/\">Sonic Temple 2026</a></p>\n",

    "title": "Metal Mantra Sets Sail: Why Shiprocked 2026 Is the Metal Festival Experience You Can\u2019t Replicate on Land",
    "content": "\n<p><strong>We&#8217;re heading back to the open ocean for six days of unfiltered heavy music chaos\u2014and this time, I&#8217;m bringing Metal Mantra with me.</strong> We&#8217;ll keep updates rolling in our <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/shiprocked/\">ShipRocked coverage</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In two days, I&#8217;m flying to Miami. Five days from now, I&#8217;ll be boarding the Carnival Horizon for <a href=\"https://www.shiprocked.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Shiprocked 2026</a>. This will be my third Shiprocked (Triple Threat status, for those keeping track), but it&#8217;s my first time covering it as Metal Mantra. The first two times, I was just another metalhead on the ship. This year? I&#8217;m bringing you all with me.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Shiprocked Hits Different</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Land-based festivals are incredible, but they&#8217;re temporary. You show up, catch your favorite bands, and everyone scatters. You&#8217;re back to real life by Monday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shiprocked doesn&#8217;t work like that. When you board the Carnival Horizon on January 22nd, you&#8217;re entering a completely self-contained metal universe for six days. The bands aren&#8217;t jetting off to the next city after their set. They&#8217;re wandering the pool deck, at the bars, standing in line for the buffet wondering why cruise ship bacon always tastes the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve done this twice before, and those moments are what stick with me. I watched Anthrax&#8217;s Joey Belladonna walk past me in board shorts holding an ice cream cone. I saw members of The Struts and Atreyu singing Bohemian Rhapsody and Whitney Houston&#8217;s I Wanna Dance with Somebody (respectively) in the piano bar at 2 AM. These aren&#8217;t curated meet-and-greets\u2014this is just what happens when you put everyone in the same space for six days. The walls between &#8220;band&#8221; and &#8220;fan&#8221; dissolve.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The 2026 Lineup: Heavier, Broader, Undeniable</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This year&#8217;s <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/shiprocked-2026-cruise-details-lineup\">Shiprocked lineup</a> actually reflects where heavy music is right now. You&#8217;ve got scene veterans like Halestorm and Suicidal Tendencies sharing the bill with modern heavy hitters like Knocked Loose and Motionless In White. There&#8217;s Wage War, AWOLNATION, <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/avatar-spring-2026-tour/\">Avatar</a>, Kittie making their triumphant return, Starset (first time back since 2018), and Sleep Theory. It&#8217;s not trying to stick to one lane, and that&#8217;s a good thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Knocked Loose on a boat is going to be absolute chaos, and I mean that as a compliment. If you&#8217;ve seen them live on land, you know what kind of energy they bring\u2014<em>suffocating</em>, relentless, and completely unhinged. Now imagine that in a room where nobody can leave. It&#8217;s going to be beautiful mayhem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Halestorm is getting a special performance slot in Nassau. Motionless In White knows how to work a crowd, and seeing them perform multiple times over six days means you get to experience different sides of what they bring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there&#8217;s the depth: From Ashes to New, &#8217;68, Dead Poet Society, The Funeral Portrait, and a whole wave of emerging acts that represent where heavy music is headed. If you&#8217;ve been sleeping on any of these bands, Shiprocked is your wake-up call.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What I&#8217;m Bringing Back</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first two times I went to Shiprocked, I went as a fan. This year, I&#8217;m going as Metal Mantra\u2014to bring this experience to people who can&#8217;t be there and tell the stories that deserve to be told.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The performances.</strong> Not just the mainstage sets. Shiprocked has smaller showcases and acoustic performances scattered throughout the week\u2014watching a metal frontman strip back their biggest songs in front of 100 people is something you can&#8217;t replicate anywhere else. This year, I&#8217;m documenting those moments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The conversations.</strong> My first two Shiprocked experiences, I had incredible random conversations with band members\u2014casual, unguarded moments you&#8217;d never get in a traditional press setting. Now that I&#8217;m going as Metal Mantra, I&#8217;m turning some of those organic moments into actual interviews. There&#8217;s something about being on a ship with no distractions that changes the quality of conversations. People are more open, more willing to go deep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The community.</strong> By day three, you&#8217;re recognizing faces everywhere, sharing tables at dinner, comparing notes on which sets destroyed you the hardest. This year, I&#8217;m documenting it and helping people who couldn&#8217;t be there feel like they&#8217;re part of it too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The unexpected moments.</strong> Impromptu jam sessions. Surprise guest appearances. Random chaos that happens when you put thousands of metalheads on a ship with nowhere else to be. I&#8217;ve learned you can&#8217;t plan for those moments\u2014but you can be ready to capture them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What to Expect</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Expect daily updates while we&#8217;re at sea (when the ship&#8217;s Wi-Fi cooperates). Expect photo galleries, video clips, and real-time reactions. Expect interviews with as many bands as I can corner between sets and pool parties. Expect honest reviews of the performances and the experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I get back, you&#8217;re getting the deep dive. The full breakdown of every set, every surprise, every moment that made Shiprocked 2026 worth the trip. I&#8217;m bringing back stories you won&#8217;t find anywhere else, because I&#8217;ll be living it alongside everyone else on that ship.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why This Matters</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Shiprocked is where the metal community shows up. Not the gatekeepers, not the elitists\u2014just fans, bands, and industry folks who are all there to celebrate heavy music in its rawest, most communal form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an era where music scenes are splintered across a thousand subgenres and online echo chambers, Shiprocked is a reminder that we&#8217;re all still part of the same thing. The kid who&#8217;s only into deathcore is standing next to the 50-year-old thrash purist, and they&#8217;re both losing their minds to the same breakdown. That unity matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And on a practical level, Shiprocked is where connections happen. Festival promoters, label reps, band managers, PR contacts\u2014they&#8217;re all on this ship, and they&#8217;re all more accessible than they&#8217;d ever be on land. This year, every connection made feeds back into making Metal Mantra better.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In two days, I&#8217;m getting on a plane to Miami. Then I&#8217;m boarding the Carnival Horizon with thousands of metalheads and some of the best heavy bands in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is my third Shiprocked, but it&#8217;s my first as Metal Mantra. The <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/shiprocked-2025-review-metal-festival-chaos-at-sea\">first two times</a> taught me what this experience is really about. This time, I&#8217;m bringing that knowledge\u2014and all of you\u2014along for the ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve been following Metal Mantra since we launched in late November, thank you. This is exactly the kind of coverage I wanted to bring you. If you&#8217;re new here, welcome aboard. You picked a hell of a week to start paying attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll see you on the other side. Stay tuned for updates, and when I get back, we&#8217;re going deep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\ud83e\udd18 Let&#8217;s do this.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Follow Metal Mantra&#8217;s Shiprocked 2026 coverage:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Live updates on Instagram Stories: @metalmantra</li>\n<li>Daily check-ins on Facebook: Metal Mantra</li>\n<li>Real-time reactions on X/Twitter: @metalmantra</li>\n<li>Join the conversation in our Discord community</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Shiprocked 2026 sets sail January 22-27 aboard the Carnival Horizon from Miami.

    "content": "\n<p>This was a messy, loud week in metal and hard rock. A long-rumored reunion tour dies in a very unglamorous way. One of metal\u2019s most enduring institutions gets the documentary treatment it deserves. Shock rock icons join forces for a tour that will absolutely sell out. Festival season continues to flex its muscle. And Lamb of God remind everyone why they\u2019re still one of the most dangerous bands on the planet. Catch more in the <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/\">latest Rundown</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Poison\u2019s 40th Anniversary Reunion Tour Officially Scrapped Amid Financial Fallout</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Poison fans hoping for a full-blown 40th anniversary victory lap are officially out of luck\u2014for now. Drummer Rikki Rockett has confirmed that plans for a reunion tour have collapsed due to internal financial disputes, effectively pulling the plug on what was shaping up to be a massive nostalgia-driven run. This wasn\u2019t a scheduling issue or a health concern. This was money. Plain and simple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Poison are no strangers to fractured timelines and selective appearances, but this one stings because it felt inevitable in the best way. The band\u2019s legacy remains intact, their catalog still moves tickets, and their name alone commands attention. Yet behind the scenes, disagreements over financial structure and expectations reportedly made the tour unworkable. It\u2019s a reminder that longevity doesn\u2019t erase old tensions\u2014it just gives them more history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For fans, the disappointment is real. For the industry, it\u2019s another example of how reunion economics can kill even the most bankable ideas. If this situation resolves, it\u2019ll be because someone blinked\u2014not because time healed anything. For now, Poison\u2019s anniversary moment remains stuck in the rehearsal room.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Judas Priest Documentary <em>The Ballad of Judas Priest</em> Set for World Premiere at Berlinale</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Metal gods don\u2019t need validation\u2014but Judas Priest getting the full documentary spotlight at the Berlin International Film Festival feels right. <em>The Ballad of Judas Priest</em> is set to make its world premiere at Berlinale, bringing decades of defiance, leather, riffs, and survival to one of the world\u2019s most respected film stages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn\u2019t just a career recap. Priest\u2019s story is metal history\u2014genre-defining albums, lineup changes, near-collapse, rebirth, and a refusal to fade quietly. From <em>British Steel</em> to <em>Painkiller</em> to their modern-era resurgence, the band has outlived trends, critics, and expectations. Seeing that story framed through a cinematic lens rather than a VH1-style gloss is a win for heavy music.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Expect deep archival footage, uncomfortable honesty, and the kind of perspective only time can provide. Judas Priest didn\u2019t just influence metal\u2014they armored it. This documentary will likely serve as both a celebration and a reckoning, and it\u2019s long overdue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4r4XQiI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener sponsored\">Explore Judas Priest vinyl and merch on Amazon</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Rob Zombie &amp; Marilyn Manson Announce Massive North American Tour</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Love them or hate them, Rob Zombie and Marilyn Manson still know how to command attention\u2014and this summer they\u2019re doing it together. The shock rock heavyweights have announced a sprawling North American tour with The Hu and Orgy in support, creating a lineup that\u2019s equal parts spectacle, aggression, and industrial chaos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zombie\u2019s live show remains one of the most reliable visual assaults in modern metal touring, while Manson\u2019s return to large-scale stages continues to spark conversation whether people want it or not. Add The Hu\u2019s throat-singing, war-metal energy and Orgy\u2019s late-\u201990s industrial resurgence, and you\u2019ve got a bill designed to hit multiple generations at once.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This tour isn\u2019t about subtlety. It\u2019s about volume, imagery, and leaning fully into what these artists do best\u2014provocation and excess. Expect packed sheds, heated debates, and zero attempts to play it safe.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Rock Fest 2026 Lineup Takes Shape With Gojira, Limp Bizkit, The Offspring, and More</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Rock Fest Wisconsin continues its evolution into one of the Midwest\u2019s most stacked rock and metal gatherings, and the early 2026 lineup proves they\u2019re not playing conservative. With Gojira, Limp Bizkit, and The Offspring leading the charge, the festival is once again bridging modern metal credibility with mainstream rock firepower.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gojira\u2019s presence alone elevates the bill, bringing precision heaviness and environmental fury to a crowd that knows how to move. Limp Bizkit remain a wild card that still pulls massive numbers, while The Offspring deliver reliable punk-rock catharsis. It\u2019s a lineup built for scale, not niche appeal\u2014and that\u2019s the point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As more bands are announced, Rock Fest 2026 is shaping up to be less about genre boundaries and more about sheer impact. This is festival booking with confidence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/festivals/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">See more festival news at Metal Mantra</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Lamb of God Announce New Album <em>Into Oblivion</em>, Drop Title Track, and Line Up 2026 World Tour</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Lamb of God aren\u2019t easing into their next era\u2014they\u2019re kicking the door off the hinges. The band has officially announced their new album <em>Into Oblivion</em>, unleashing the ferocious title track alongside news of a massive North American and European tour slated for 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new material sounds like a band with nothing left to prove and zero interest in restraint. It\u2019s sharp, violent, and purposeful\u2014classic Lamb of God energy sharpened by decades of road damage and studio discipline. This isn\u2019t a nostalgia play. This is momentum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tour dates stretch across major markets and key festivals, positioning <em>Into Oblivion</em> as one of the most anticipated heavy releases of the year. Lamb of God continue to exist in that rare space where underground credibility and arena-level impact collide\u2014and they\u2019re not slowing down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3LHxUKT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener sponsored\">Pre-order Lamb of God on Amazon</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/lamb-of-god/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">More Lamb of God coverage</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More from Metal Mantra:</strong> <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/headbangers-boat-2026-lineup/\">Headbangers Boat 2026</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/\">Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026</a></p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>The Devil Wears Prada have never been a nostalgia act\u2014but they\u2019re also not afraid to look the past dead in the eye and laugh at it. Today, the band officially unleashed <strong>\u201cPlay The Old Shit\u201d</strong>, a previously vinyl-only secret track tucked away at the end of the <em>Flowers</em> LP. Fans found it. Fans demanded it. TDWP listened. Tickets and tour roundups live on our <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tours/\">Tours &amp; Tickets hub</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now it\u2019s live on streaming services, loud and unapologetic. <a href=\"https://tdwp.ffm.to/oldshit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Listen here</a>, or watch the official visualizer below. No marketing fluff. No mystery left unsolved. Just a blunt, straightforward track that hits different precisely because it wasn\u2019t meant to be front-and-center.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frontman <strong>Mike Hranica</strong> summed it up best: the band has never really messed with secret songs before, but once the vinyl-only experiment ran its course, it was always coming to digital. Within the context of <em>Flowers</em>, the track flips the emotional switch at the very end. It\u2019s not subtle\u2014and that\u2019s the point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s be clear: <em>Flowers</em> isn\u2019t a victory lap album. It\u2019s a band 20 years deep still pushing forward instead of recycling riffs for easy applause. If you\u2019ve followed TDWP from <em>With Roots Above and Branches Below</em> through <em>Color Decay</em>, this secret track feels like a knowing smirk from a band that\u2019s earned the right to mess with expectations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you somehow still don\u2019t own the record, you can grab <em>Flowers</em> here: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3LIgf5D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Amazon</a>. Vinyl heads already know why it matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Spring 2026 Tour: No Breaks, No Mercy</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As if the song drop wasn\u2019t enough, TDWP are rolling straight into a full Spring 2026 headline tour. After a 2025 run that took them from Warped Tour Orlando to South Africa, Australia, and across Europe, the band clearly has no interest in slowing down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tour kicks off March 13 in Oklahoma City and runs through April 12 in Nashville, with support from <strong>Four Year Strong</strong>, <strong>Split Chain</strong>, and <strong>I Promised The World</strong>. That\u2019s not a soft lineup. That\u2019s controlled chaos by design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fthe-devil-wears-prada-tickets%2Fartist%2F1278537\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Tickets are on sale now</a>. If you\u2019ve seen TDWP live recently, you already know they\u2019re sharper, heavier, and more locked-in than ever.

Whether it\u2019s club runs or major festival slots, TDWP don\u2019t phone it in\u2014and this Spring 2026 tour reads like another reminder that they\u2019re still one of metalcore\u2019s most reliable live bands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Between a surprise song release, a relentless touring schedule, and an album that refuses to play it safe, The Devil Wears Prada aren\u2019t chasing their legacy\u2014they\u2019re actively trying to outgrow it. Some bands age gracefully. Others stay dangerous. TDWP are clearly choosing the latter.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"The Devil Wears Prada - Play The Old Shit\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/j0Fv1Ma5lmo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"576\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/e7eb637d-b260-c3a9-1c6e-c4b67ef116ab-576x1024.jpg\" alt=\"The Devil Wears Prada Flowers Tour Spring 2026 concert poster featuring collage-style artwork, tour dates, and support from Four Year Strong, Split Chain, and I Promised The World.\" class=\"wp-image-3506\" srcset=\"https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/e7eb637d-b260-c3a9-1c6e-c4b67ef116ab-576x1024.jpg 576w, https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/e7eb637d-b260-c3a9-1c6e-c4b67ef116ab-169x300.jpg 169w, https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/e7eb637d-b260-c3a9-1c6e-c4b67ef116ab-768x1365.jpg 768w, https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/e7eb637d-b260-c3a9-1c6e-c4b67ef116ab-864x1536.jpg 864w, https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/e7eb637d-b260-c3a9-1c6e-c4b67ef116ab.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>More from the band: <a href=\"https://tdwpband.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">official site</a> | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tdwpband/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram</a> | <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/TDWP\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YouTube</a></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More Metal Mantra:</strong> <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/resistor-bite-this-album-dead-soul-video/\">Resistor Announce \u2018BITE THIS!\u2019 Album, Share \u2018Dead Soul\u2019 Video</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/metallica-sphere-las-vegas-2026/\">Metallica Announce &#8220;Life Burns Faster&#8221; Residency at the Sphere in Las Vegas \u2014 8 Shows, October 2026</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/death-angel-act-iii-tour-2026/\">Death Angel Announce Act III 35th Anniversary Tour Leg 2 With Vio-lence + Incite \u2014 35 U.S. Dates</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More from Metal Mantra:</strong> <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/headbangers-boat-2026-lineup/\">Headbangers Boat 2026</a></p>\n",

    "title": "Metal & Hard Rock News \u2013 January 16, 2026: Tours Stack Up, Festivals Flex, and the Big Dogs Play Long Games",
    "content": "\n<p>The metal and hard rock world never really sleeps\u2014it just shifts gears. This week proves it again. Legacy bands are celebrating milestones without watering themselves down, extreme metal is loading the van for another brutal lap, and festival season is already throwing elbows for your attention. There\u2019s nostalgia here, sure, but it\u2019s backed by volume, intent, and very real forward momentum. Catch more in the <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/\">latest Rundown</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Five Finger Death Punch</strong> are officially rolling out their 20th Anniversary tour, and no one should be surprised that they\u2019re treating it like a victory lap rather than a farewell. Two decades in, FFDP remain one of modern metal\u2019s most polarizing and commercially dominant forces, and this tour is built to remind people exactly how many hits they\u2019ve stacked since the early 2000s. Big U.S. stops anchor the run, and the support lineup adds unexpected texture\u2014<strong>Cody Jinks</strong> brings outlaw country grit, while <strong>Eva Under Fire</strong> continue their climb through hard rock\u2019s upper tiers. If you want a refresher on where it all started, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3LJ7Ej4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The Way of the Fist</a> still hits as hard as ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Raven</strong>, meanwhile, are proving yet again that the NWOBHM spirit doesn\u2019t age out\u2014it sharpens. The band announced a spring run with <strong>Slackjaw</strong>, pairing classic British heavy metal roots with modern underground aggression. Raven have always thrived in live settings, and this tour looks aimed squarely at diehards who still value sweat, riffs, and proximity over spectacle. No gimmicks. No apologies. Just volume and history colliding with the present.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of collisions, <strong>The Black Dahlia Murder</strong> are back on U.S. roads with a lineup that reads like a deathcore and extreme metal pressure cooker. Joined by <strong>The Acacia Strain</strong>, <strong>Disembodied Tyrant</strong>, and additional rotating support, this tour feels intentionally unhinged. TBDM have spent years earning their reputation as one of the most reliable live acts in extreme metal, and pairing them with bands that thrive on chaos guarantees zero breathing room in the pit. This isn\u2019t nostalgia death metal\u2014it\u2019s a reminder that the genre is still violent, modern, and very much alive. Their recent era deserves a revisit, especially <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4pMnJ5v\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Nightbringers</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Festival season is already heating up too, and <strong>BottleRock Napa Valley 2026</strong> just threw its hat firmly into the rock and metal conversation. The newly revealed daily lineup includes <strong><a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/papa-roach/\">Papa Roach</a></strong>, <strong><a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/the-warning/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/the-warning/\">The Warning</a></strong>, <strong>Bush</strong>, and <strong>Joan Jett</strong>, all sharing space with headliners like <strong>Foo Fighters</strong> over Memorial Day Weekend. BottleRock has always leaned eclectic, but this year\u2019s roster feels like a calculated reach toward heavier audiences without abandoning mainstream appeal. It\u2019s not a pit-first festival, but it\u2019s undeniably recognizing where rock momentum is coming from. Fans chasing heavier festival energy should also revisit our <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/inkcarceration/\">Inkcarceration coverage</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the opposite end of the spectrum, <strong>Behemoth</strong> are dragging the underground straight into the fire with the announcement of the <strong>Godless IV North American Tour</strong>. With <strong>Deicide</strong>, <strong>Immolation</strong>, and <strong>Rotting Christ</strong> in tow, this run is stacked with extreme metal lifers who don\u2019t soften edges or chase trends. Behemoth\u2019s recent output has leaned massive and confrontational, and this tour lineup reinforces their role as both torchbearers and gatekeepers. If you need a sonic reminder of their current form, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Ljwq9D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Opvs Contra Natvram</a> is mandatory listening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Black Label Society</strong> are also loading the chamber with fresh album news and a sprawling tour plan that includes a long-awaited EU/UK run. Most notably, the band will hit Scotland for the first time in 11 years, a detail longtime fans won\u2019t overlook. Zakk Wylde\u2019s machine has always thrived on consistency\u2014groove-heavy riffs, biker-metal swagger, and no-frills execution. New material paired with deep catalog cuts is a proven formula, and BLS know exactly who they\u2019re playing for. Revisiting Mafia before the tour isn\u2019t a bad idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the biggest long-game headline of the week: <strong><a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/metallica/\">Metallica</a></strong> are reportedly in advanced talks for a massive 2027 residency at the Sphere in Las Vegas. If it happens, it would mark one of the most ambitious intersections of heavy metal and high-tech live production ever attempted. Metallica have never been content to tour like everyone else, and the Sphere represents a playground big enough to match their vision. This isn\u2019t about reinvention\u2014it\u2019s about scale, control, and once again forcing the industry to follow their lead. If you want context on how they got here, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4bBHf1e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">\u2026And Justice for All</a> still tells the story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Different lanes. Different volumes. Same result: metal and hard rock are entering 2026 loud, busy, and unapologetically active.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>Inkcarceration doesn\u2019t quietly announce lineups. It slams them down and dares you to keep up. More metal news: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/news/\">News hub</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After pulling more than 90,000 people into the Ohio State Reformatory last year \u2014 a literal former prison turned pressure cooker for riffs, sweat, and bad decisions \u2014 <strong>Inkcarceration 2026</strong> is back July 17\u201319 with a lineup that feels deliberately unhinged in the best way possible. Over 65 bands. Three stages. Zero filler.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn\u2019t a festival that hedges its bets. It stacks the deck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Friday</strong> kicks the gates open with Disturbed, Papa Roach, Cypress Hill, and Hollywood Undead \u2014 a collision of eras that still works because these bands know exactly who they are and why people still show up. <strong>Saturday</strong> pivots hard as Bad Omens officially steps into true headliner territory alongside Gojira, The Used, and Sleeping With Sirens. <strong>Sunday</strong> shuts the lights off with Limp Bizkit, A Day To Remember, Motionless In White, and Ice Nine Kills \u2014 loud, theatrical, and completely on-brand for a festival that\u2019s never been subtle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c<em>Get busy living, or get busy dying</em>,\u201d Ice Nine Kills frontman Spencer Charnas said, borrowing directly from <em>The Shawshank Redemption</em>. \u201c<em>We\u2019re thrilled to share our songs of living and dying when INK descends on Inkcarceration.</em>\u201d If you\u2019ve ever stood in that yard at night while the lights cut through the cell blocks, you already understand why that quote lands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Inkcarceration has never lived or died on its headliners alone. The depth is where it earns its reputation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Machine Head. Jinjer. Hatebreed. Lorna Shore. Fit For A King. LANDMVRKS. Dying Wish. Sanguisugabogg. Norma Jean. Silent Planet. Born of Osiris. Spite. PeelingFlesh. Miss May I. Hardcore, deathcore, metalcore, industrial, and straight-up pit violence all sharing the same unforgiving space. This is the kind of lineup where stage-hopping is mandatory and conflicts are guaranteed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Special moments are baked into the weekend. Sleeping With Sirens celebrate 15 years of <em>Let\u2019s Cheers To This</em>. Rev Theory reunites. Alien Ant Farm marks 25 years of <em>ANThology</em>. Ohio acts like Starset, Miss May I, Sanguisugabogg, Wolves At The Gate, and others get home-field advantage \u2014 and that energy always hits harder inside these walls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there\u2019s the part no schedule can prepare you for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inkcarceration is chaos between sets. It\u2019s getting tattooed inside a former maximum-security prison. It\u2019s wandering cell blocks that once held real inmates while bass rattles the concrete. It\u2019s dust storms ripping through circle pits, medics moving through crowds, bands stopping mid-set just to stare at the building they\u2019re playing next to. Past years have delivered heat exhaustion, surprise guest appearances, spontaneous tattoos, and stories that sound fake until you meet three other people who were standing right there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s a reason Danny Wimmer Presents keeps documenting this place. The <em>Paranormal Prison</em> series didn\u2019t come out of nowhere \u2014 artists, crew, and fans have been swapping stories about strange experiences here for years. Whether you believe in that side of it or not, the atmosphere is undeniable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DWP founder Danny Wimmer doesn\u2019t downplay what this lineup represents. \u201c<em>We\u2019re fired up to welcome Limp Bizkit back to Inkcarceration. Their recent South American stadium run sent social media into overdrive. Having Bad Omens headline a DWP festival for the first time brings a whole new level of energy \u2014 and adding Disturbed makes this lineup an absolute powerhouse.</em>\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inkcarceration co-founder Dan Janssen echoed that sentiment. \u201c<em>After selling out every year since 2021, this summer brings one of our most in-demand lineups to date\u2026 combined with upgrades across the site, camping, and parking experience, we\u2019re excited to welcome fans back for what will be the biggest INK yet.</em>\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Translation: this isn\u2019t a victory lap \u2014 it\u2019s an escalation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All pass types \u2014 3-day, single-day, GA, and VIP \u2014 are on sale now at <a href=\"https://inkcarceration.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Inkcarceration.com</a>, including layaway options, new student pricing for 2026, and GOVX discounts for military and first responders. Camping, RV packages, and hotel bundles are available, and anyone who\u2019s survived an Ink weekend knows camping is where half the stories are born.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inkcarceration lives in the same ecosystem as <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/sonic-temple/\">Sonic Temple</a>, <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/welcome-to-rockville/\">Welcome To Rockville</a>, and <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/aftershock-festival/\">Aftershock</a> \u2014 but it plays by its own rules. The setting matters. The curation matters. And once you\u2019ve watched a breakdown hit as the sun drops behind prison walls, normal festivals feel a little too clean.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inkcarceration 2026 isn\u2019t just another weekend on the calendar. It\u2019s a test of volume, stamina, and commitment. And judging by its track record, it\u2019s going to sell out \u2014 again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tickets:</strong> <a href=\"https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3DInkcarceration\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Get Inkcarceration tickets on Ticketmaster</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More from Metal Mantra:</strong> <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/\">Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-metal-tracks-of-2025/\">Top 10 Metal Tracks of 2025</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/welcome-to-rockville-2026/\">Welcome to Rockville 2026</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/sonic-temple-2026/\">Sonic Temple 2026</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/aftershock-2025-review/\">Aftershock 2025</a></p>\n",

    "content": "\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Vicious Rumors Announce Massive 2026 U.S. Tour, Drop New \u201cAbusement Park\u201d Video</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Vicious Rumors aren\u2019t here to play nostalgia bingo. They\u2019re here to remind everyone\u2014loudly\u2014that U.S. power metal still has teeth. The band just unleashed a new video for <strong>\u201cAbusement Park\u201d</strong> and paired it with a sprawling 2026 U.S. tour that reads like a no-frills, bar-to-the-back-wall metal assault. Tickets and tour roundups live on our <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tours/\">Tours &amp; Tickets hub</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAbusement Park\u201d comes off <em><a href=\"/the-devils-asylum-vicious-rumors-review\">The Devil\u2019s Asylum</a></em>, and it hits exactly how you want a modern Vicious Rumors track to hit: sharp riffs, double-kick pressure, and a chorus that doesn\u2019t beg for approval. It\u2019s aggressive without being sloppy, melodic without going soft. That balance is harder to pull off than people admit\u2014and plenty of bands fail at it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n <iframe title=\"Vicious Rumors - Abusement Park (Official Video)\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cGGH5YVnANI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Founder and guitarist Geoff Thorpe has never pretended this band exists for casual listeners, and that\u2019s exactly why Vicious Rumors still matter. The song\u2019s warped theme-park-from-hell concept fits the band\u2019s long-standing approach\u2014metal as confrontation, not comfort. If you want safe, algorithm-approved background noise, look elsewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The video itself jumps locations across Germany, Sweden, Florida, and Kentucky, but the real point isn\u2019t geography\u2014it\u2019s momentum. After tour delays caused by Thorpe\u2019s shoulder injury, the band is clearly itching to get back in front of real crowds.

    "content": "\n<p><a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/avatar/\">Avatar</a> don\u2019t rest. They don\u2019t reset. They don\u2019t politely disappear between album cycles. They march forward, eyes wide open, dragging their twisted carnival straight through the woods \u2014 and now they\u2019re bringing it back to North America. Tickets and tour roundups live on our <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tours/\">Tours &amp; Tickets hub</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Swedish metal lifers have officially announced a Spring 2026 U.S. headline tour in support of <em>Don\u2019t Go In The Forest</em>, their latest full-length, which dropped fittingly on Halloween. If you\u2019ve been paying attention, you already know this record didn\u2019t come quietly. It crept in. Then it grabbed you by the throat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4sBClHA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Purchase <em>Don\u2019t Go In The Forest</em> here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The band \u2014 Johannes Eckerstr\u00f6m, Jonas Jarlsby, Tim \u00d6hrstr\u00f6m, Henrik Sandelin, and John Alfredsson \u2014 already tore through North America once, then immediately doubled down with relentless international dates. This next run isn\u2019t a victory lap. It\u2019s another descent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Spring 2026 tour kicks off April 16 in Sacramento and runs through May 20 in Hampton Beach, New Hampshire, with appearances at festivals <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/welcome-to-rockville-2026/\">Welcome to Rockville 2026</a> and <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/sonic-temple-2026/\">Sonic Temple 2026</a>. Fleshgod Apocalypse and Frozen Soul are on support, which means this bill leans heavy, punishing, and unapologetically metal. No filler. No mercy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eckerstr\u00f6m, never one to deliver a normal quote, summed up the band\u2019s return to the States in true Avatar fashion:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cUSA. It started off innocently enough. Hiking along on a trail. Sunny. Pleasant. Safe. Then night came, and the trail slowly faded. You can&#8217;t go back, as you don&#8217;t know where you came from. You don&#8217;t even dare to turn around, as you can feel someone, or something, watching\u2026 Here. It\u2019s just you and the trees.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Then he adds, calmly and ominously: \u201cWe will be seeing you.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Avatar aren\u2019t pretending anymore. They know exactly what they are \u2014 a fully realized metal institution built on theatrics, riffs, and controlled madness. And live? They\u2019re still one of the most dangerous bands you can see on a stage right now. If you\u2019ve somehow missed them, that\u2019s on you. Fix it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tickets go on sale Friday, January 16 at 10am local time. <a href=\"https://avatarmetal.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Get tickets here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Avatar \u2013 \u201cDon\u2019t Go In The Forest\u201d Spring 2026 Tour Dates</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>4/16 \u2014 Sacramento, CA \u2014 Channel 24</li>\n\n\n\n<li>4/17 \u2014 Los Angeles, CA \u2014 Novo</li>\n\n\n\n<li>4/19 \u2014 Tucson, AZ \u2014 Rialto Theater</li>\n\n\n\n<li>4/20 \u2014 Albuquerque, NM \u2014 Revel</li>\n\n\n\n<li>4/22 \u2014 San Antonio, TX \u2014 Aztec</li>\n\n\n\n<li>4/23 \u2014 Oklahoma City, OK \u2014 Criterion</li>\n\n\n\n<li>4/25 \u2014 Omaha, NE \u2014 Steelhouse Omaha</li>\n\n\n\n<li>4/26 \u2014 Des Moines, IA \u2014 Val Air</li>\n\n\n\n<li>4/28 \u2014 Lawrence, KS \u2014 Liberty Hall</li>\n\n\n\n<li>4/29 \u2014 Moline, IL \u2014 The Rust Belt</li>\n\n\n\n<li>4/30 \u2014 Grand Rapids, MI \u2014 GLC Live at 20 Monroe</li>\n\n\n\n<li>5/1 \u2014 Milwaukee, WI \u2014 Eagles Club Stage</li>\n\n\n\n<li>5/2 \u2014 Fort Wayne, IN \u2014 The Clyde</li>\n\n\n\n<li>5/4 \u2014 Huntsville, AL \u2014 VBC Mars Music Hall</li>\n\n\n\n<li>5/5 \u2014 Atlanta, GA \u2014 Tabernacle</li>\n\n\n\n<li>5/6 \u2014 Knoxville, TN \u2014 Mill &amp; Mine</li>\n\n\n\n<li>5/7 \u2014 Myrtle Beach, SC \u2014 House of Blues</li>\n\n\n\n<li>5/9 \u2014 Daytona Beach, FL \u2014 Welcome to Rockville*</li>\n\n\n\n<li>5/10 \u2014 Raleigh, NC \u2014 The Ritz</li>\n\n\n\n<li>5/12 \u2014 Richmond, VA \u2014 The National</li>\n\n\n\n<li>5/13 \u2014 Philadelphia, PA \u2014 Franklin Music Hall</li>\n\n\n\n<li>5/15 \u2014 New York, NY \u2014 Palladium Times Square</li>\n\n\n\n<li>5/16 \u2014 Buffalo, NY \u2014 Buffalo Riverworks</li>\n\n\n\n<li>5/17 \u2014 Columbus, OH \u2014 Sonic Temple*</li>\n\n\n\n<li>5/19 \u2014 Wallingford, CT \u2014 The Dome</li>\n\n\n\n<li>5/20 \u2014 Hampton Beach, NH \u2014 Hampton Beach Casino</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>*Festival appearance</em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"812\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2743dbee-fa48-d207-413a-0bfbb548a9a0-812x1024.png\" alt=\"Poster artwork for Avatar\u2019s Don\u2019t Go In The Forest 2026 tour featuring a stylized face emerging from dark woods with tour dates and special guests listed.\" class=\"wp-image-3479\" srcset=\"https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2743dbee-fa48-d207-413a-0bfbb548a9a0-812x1024.png 812w, https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2743dbee-fa48-d207-413a-0bfbb548a9a0-238x300.png 238w, https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2743dbee-fa48-d207-413a-0bfbb548a9a0-768x968.png 768w, https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/2743dbee-fa48-d207-413a-0bfbb548a9a0.png 1104w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 812px) 100vw, 812px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Don\u2019t Go In The Forest \u2013 Track Listing</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DiTI92w0VY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tonight We Must Be Warriors</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhZYvpydl9A\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">In The Airwaves</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRSFJm803os\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Captain Goat</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/MtnFEIn2glE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don\u2019t Go In The Forest</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/7HOakrMmC2I\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Death And Glitz</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Abduction Song</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Howling At The Waves</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Dead And Gone And Back Again</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Take This Heart And Burn</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Magic Lantern</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Avatar will also spend 2026 crisscrossing Europe on a headline run and joining Metallica for massive summer stadium dates \u2014 because apparently slowing down isn\u2019t an option.

After joining Suicidal Tendencies in 2024 following his decade-plus tenure behind the kit for Slipknot, Jay posted a heartfelt message explaining that the next chapter of his life \u2014 including becoming a father and chasing passion projects \u2014 means he\u2019s leaving the Cyco legacy behind after nearly two years and countless miles in the van. The split sounds genuinely amicable, but that doesn\u2019t stop it from hitting like a gut-punch for a lot of fans who came to associate him with ST\u2019s touring and recent material.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile Calvin \u201cCaleb\u201d Freihaut\u2019s departure from <strong><a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/the-funeral-portrait/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/the-funeral-portrait/\">The Funeral Portrait</a></strong> carries a very different kind of weight \u2014 because this is a band very much on the ascent. TFP have quietly positioned themselves as one of the most talked-about up-and-coming acts heading into 2026, blending theatrical rock, post-hardcore bite, and metal-adjacent intensity in a way that\u2019s been connecting with a rapidly growing audience. Caleb wasn\u2019t just a background contributor; he was part of the chemistry that helped push the band from cult favorite territory into legitimate breakout conversation. When someone exits a band right as momentum is accelerating, it naturally raises eyebrows \u2014 not because of drama, but because timing matters.</p>\n<p>What makes the situation even more surreal is the overlap. Both <strong>The Funeral Portrait</strong> and <strong>Suicidal Tendencies</strong> are slated to appear on <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/shiprocked/\">Shiprocked</a> in just a couple of weeks \u2014 a floating festival that thrives on fan access, shared stages, and scene crossover. On paper, that lineup now feels almost ironic. Two bands from wildly different eras, both dealing with key departures right before stepping onto one of the most visible rock-centric platforms of the year. That kind of coincidence doesn\u2019t happen often, and it\u2019s not lost on fans paying attention.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not just these two. Heavy music has been in something of a lineup shuffle \u2014 not mass defections, but meaningful exits. Early last year, Exodus saw longtime frontman Steve \u201cZetro\u201d Souza part ways with the band, bringing back Rob Dukes in his stead; it wasn\u2019t acrimony on tour, but a classic \u201cmarriage over\u201d exit that still had claws in fan discussions.</p>\n<p>And while it was announced before that Brandon Ellis had left <strong>The Black Dahlia Murder</strong> in early 2025, that shakeup still lingers in the scene\u2019s memory because of how integral he was to that band\u2019s sound for years. Some exits fade fast. Others hang in the air long after the announcement post disappears down the timeline.</p>\n<p>Departure news isn\u2019t always bad news \u2014 bands evolve, people grow, priorities shift \u2014 but when someone like Weinberg exits a high-profile outfit, or when a key player leaves rising bands like The Funeral Portrait or Dayseeker, it feels like a snapshot of how even the most dedicated musicians wrestle with the tension between touring life, family, side projects, and long-term creative goals.</p>\n<p>Weinberg made a point of thanking Suicidal Tendencies and the extended \u201cST Army\u201d in his farewell, framing this as a step toward becoming a first-time father and pushing his own artistic endeavors. That\u2019s not vague PR speak \u2014 it\u2019s a drummer who\u2019s playing the long game and admitting he\u2019s exhausted the well of what he wanted out of that chapter.</p>\n<p>Caleb\u2019s departure from The Funeral Portrait doesn\u2019t come wrapped in mystery or coded language \u2014 and that honesty matters. In his own words, Caleb explained that \u201cafter many years of heavy touring, which have resulted in intense burnout,\u201d he made the decision to step away in order to prioritize his mental health and invest in other parts of his life. That kind of clarity cuts through the usual speculation fast. Still, in a scene that runs on momentum, timing always invites conversation. When members leave just ahead of major tours or release cycles, it naturally feeds into questions about direction, chemistry, and the toll relentless grind culture takes on musicians \u2014 even the ones who look like they\u2019re winning from the outside.</p>\n<p>The broader picture? Band member exits are happening, but not in a way that suggests wholesale collapse. This feels like individual stories about people making personal choices \u2014 whether it\u2019s reclaiming life outside of punishing tour schedules or stepping away from a project that\u2019s outgrown its earlier mission. For heavy fans, it\u2019s a reminder that the metal and hardcore landscapes are living, breathing things where the only constant is flux.</p>\n<p>We\u2019ll be tracking these stories as they develop \u2014 new replacements, side projects, and the ripple effects that come with lineup changes will all shape the heavy music narrative in the months ahead.</p>\n<p><strong>More from Metal Mantra:</strong></p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>It\u2019s not metal. Let\u2019s get that out of the way. But if you give a damn about musicianship, risk-taking, and the kind of live-wire mindset that heavy music feeds on, <strong>Bob Weir</strong> matters. A lot. More metal news: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/news/\">News hub</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>Grateful Dead</strong> co-founder, singer, and rhythm guitarist has died at <strong>78</strong>. According to his family, Weir passed away on <strong>January 10, 2026</strong>, following a long fight with cancer and complications tied to lung issues. He died peacefully, surrounded by family. He leaves behind his wife of 26 years, <strong>Natascha M\u00fcnter Weir</strong>, and their daughters, <strong>Monet</strong> and <strong>Chloe</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don\u2019t have to own a tie-dye shirt to understand the weight of that loss.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Rhythm Guitarist Who Refused to Stay in His Lane</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Weir wasn\u2019t a flashy shredder. He didn\u2019t need to be. What he did instead was twist rhythm guitar into something restless and confrontational \u2014 fractured chord shapes, off-kilter voicings, parts that moved sideways instead of straight ahead. He didn\u2019t play <em>under</em> Jerry Garcia. He played <em>against</em> him, around him, and sometimes straight through him. That tension is where the magic lived.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That approach shaped decades of live improvisational music, whether metal fans want to admit it or not. Long-form jams. Night-to-night setlist changes. Treating the stage like a laboratory instead of a jukebox. Sound familiar?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weir\u2019s voice and pen are stamped all over Dead staples like <strong>\u201cTruckin\u2019,\u201d \u201cSugar Magnolia,\u201d \u201cJack Straw,\u201d</strong> and <strong>\u201cPlaying in the Band.\u201d</strong> Songs that mutated onstage, sometimes beyond recognition, and dared audiences to keep up. That wasn\u2019t nostalgia music. That was confrontation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Career Built on Movement, Not Preservation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After <strong>Jerry Garcia</strong> died in 1995, Weir didn\u2019t freeze the band in amber. He kept pushing forward through projects like <strong>RatDog</strong>, <strong>Furthur</strong>, and eventually <strong>Dead &amp; Company</strong>. Same songbook. Different fire. He understood something a lot of legacy acts don\u2019t: the past means nothing if it\u2019s not alive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was still touring deep into his seventies, standing onstage night after night, refusing to turn one of the most obsessive fanbases in music into a museum crowd. Dead &amp; Company\u2019s 2023 farewell run pulled nearly a million people. That doesn\u2019t happen by accident. That happens because the music still <em>worked</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tributes From Across the Scene</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tributes poured in fast. <strong>Trey Anastasio</strong> called Weir a close friend and admitted the loss hit hard. <strong>Billy Corgan</strong> kept it simple. <strong>Slash</strong> shared his respect without needing to explain it. That spread tells you everything \u2014 Weir\u2019s reach didn\u2019t stop at jam bands or classic rock lifers. Musicians recognized one of their own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even outside the music world, Weir was acknowledged as a cultural force \u2014 a California original who helped define what American rock music could be when it stopped obeying rules.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blunt truth: Bob Weir wasn\u2019t metal. But metal\u2019s obsession with live danger, extended performances, and communal devotion owes him a debt whether it wants to admit it or not. You don\u2019t have to love the Grateful Dead to respect the architecture they built.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bob Weir leaves behind a legacy that refuses to sit still \u2014 restless, imperfect, and loud in its own way. That\u2019s worth saluting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More Metal Mantra: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/\">Rundowns</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tours/\">Metal Tours</a></p>\n",

The Norwegian black metal lifers have dropped a new video for <strong>\u201cLife Is a Corpse You Drag\u201d</strong>, the latest cut from their upcoming album <em>Liturgy of Death</em>, due out February 6. If you were hoping for nostalgia, irony, or anything resembling mercy, look elsewhere. This is Mayhem doing what they\u2019ve always done best: staring straight into the void and daring it to blink first. More metal news: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/news/\">News hub</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> Stream the track here: <a href=\"https://mayhemband.lnk.to/LifeIsACorpseYouDrag-Single\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://mayhemband.lnk.to/LifeIsACorpseYouDrag-Single</a></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"MAYHEM \u2013 Life is a Corpse You Drag (Official Visualizer)\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/g7PZQHHtU2g?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Liturgy of Death</em> marks the band\u2019s seventh full-length and lands with the weight of four decades of scars, controversy, and survival behind it. Mortality isn\u2019t treated like a poetic metaphor here \u2014 it\u2019s a law. An unavoidable one. Mayhem frame death not as an ending, but as the constant pressure shaping every breath before it. It\u2019s bleak, sure, but it\u2019s also brutally honest. And honesty has always been their sharpest weapon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Attila doesn\u2019t sugarcoat it either. Speaking on the new track, he describes it as \u201cnot a slogan, but a ritual and a realization,\u201d reducing consciousness to burden and the body to a temporary vessel already marked for the grave. There\u2019s no self-help nonsense hiding in the margins. The message is simple and cold: if we\u2019ve been dead all along, fear loses its power. That\u2019s not comforting \u2014 it\u2019s liberating in the most violent way possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This lineup \u2014 Necrobutcher, Hellhammer, Attila, Ghul, and Morten Bergeton Iversen \u2014 sounds locked in and vicious. No frills. No polish for the sake of accessibility. Just dark, fast, unrelenting black metal that feels alive because it refuses to pretend otherwise. Forty-one years in, Mayhem still sound dangerous, and that alone puts them miles ahead of bands half their age.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pre-order <em>Liturgy of Death</em> here: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/49vkcmd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"></a> </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-medium\"><a href=\"https://amzn.to/49vkcmd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bec50e4a-3c86-c50d-780b-294464524a5f-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"Mayhem Liturgy of Death album cover featuring skull, occult objects, and ritual imagery\" class=\"wp-image-3454\" srcset=\"https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bec50e4a-3c86-c50d-780b-294464524a5f-300x300.jpg 300w, https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bec50e4a-3c86-c50d-780b-294464524a5f-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bec50e4a-3c86-c50d-780b-294464524a5f-150x150.jpg 150w, https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bec50e4a-3c86-c50d-780b-294464524a5f-768x768.jpg 768w, https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bec50e4a-3c86-c50d-780b-294464524a5f.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Liturgy of Death Track List</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Ephemeral Eternity (feat.

    "content": "\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/headbangers-boat/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/headbangers-boat/\">Headbangers Boat</a></strong> isn\u2019t just another festival announcement \u2014 it\u2019s a reminder that heavy metal still has its own rules. The 2026 edition is officially locked in, and once again Lamb of God are steering this floating nightmare straight into open water. Forget mellow ocean cruises and watered-down \u201crock vacations.\u201d This is a four-day, no-bullshit metal assault where riffs replace relaxation and sleep is optional. More metal news: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/news/\">News hub</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From October 30 through November 3, 2026, the <a href=\"https://www.headbangersboat.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Norwegian Jewel</a> becomes a steel-clad, riff-fueled war zone, sailing from Miami to Great Stirrup Cay in the Bahamas. No steel drums. No cruise directors. Just stages, pits, bars, and thousands of metalheads who know exactly why they\u2019re there.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Is Headbangers Boat?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For the uninitiated, Headbangers Boat is the definitive <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/metal-cruise/\">heavy metal cruise</a> \u2014 a floating festival built by metalheads, for metalheads. Curated and headlined by Lamb of God, it strips away the corporate nonsense and replaces it with stacked lineups, intimate performances, and a rare sense of community that most land festivals can\u2019t touch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn\u2019t about checking boxes or chasing trends. It\u2019s about extreme music, legacy acts, underground chaos, and fans who actually care. Everyone eats together, drinks together, and loses their voice together. There\u2019s no VIP divide \u2014 just decks, stages, and shared bruises.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Headbangers Boat 2026 Dates, Ship &amp; Route</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dates:</strong> October 30 \u2013 November 3, 2026<br>\n<strong>Ship:</strong> Norwegian Jewel<br>\n<strong>Route:</strong> Miami \u2192 Great Stirrup Cay, Bahamas \u2192 Miami</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Halloween timing isn\u2019t accidental. Costumes take over the ship, stage lights hit harder after dark, and the entire experience leans into controlled chaos. It\u2019s a rare blend of festival intensity and close-quarter insanity that simply doesn\u2019t exist on land.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Headbangers Boat 2026 Lineup Breakdown</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2026 lineup doesn\u2019t play it safe. It leans heavy, weird, aggressive, and unapologetically metal.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Headliners &amp; Anchors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/lamb-of-god/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/lamb-of-god/\">Lamb of God</a></strong> once again command the ship, and at this point, Headbangers Boat is as much their domain as any stage they touch. These sets hit harder knowing there\u2019s no barricade between band and crowd \u2014 just deck railings and ocean air.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Zakk Sabbath</strong> delivers Sabbath worship the right way \u2014 loud, low, and filthy. Doom riffs hit different when you\u2019re surrounded by saltwater and sunburned necks snapping in unison.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Extreme &amp; Legacy Acts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Dillinger Escape Plan</strong> bring controlled chaos to open water, turning mathcore into something borderline dangerous when there\u2019s nowhere to escape. <strong>In Flames</strong> represent Swedish melodeath royalty, balancing melody and aggression with surgical precision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/death-angel/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/death-angel/\">Death Angel</a></strong> keep thrash alive and feral, while <strong>The Haunted</strong> and <strong>D.R.I.</strong> inject old-school violence that still feels relevant decades later.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Brutality, Sludge &amp; Hardcore</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>All Shall Perish</strong> return with deathcore devastation, <strong>200 Stab Wounds</strong> keep things bloody and blunt, and <strong>Harm\u2019s Way</strong> provide hardcore heaviness that hits like concrete. <strong>Kylesa</strong> bring sludge-soaked atmosphere, while <strong>Soilent Green</strong> inject grimy Southern extremity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Add in <strong>GWAR</strong> for theatrical destruction, <strong>X-Cops</strong> for cult chaos, plus appearances from <strong>Mark Morton Band</strong> and <strong>Chained Saint</strong>, and you\u2019ve got a lineup that refuses to sit still.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Brief History of Headbangers Boat</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What started as a borderline insane idea \u2014 putting extreme metal on a cruise ship \u2014 has evolved into one of the most respected niche festivals in the scene. Past voyages have featured Carcass, Napalm Death, Exodus, Unearth, and countless others, proving year after year that metal doesn\u2019t need massive fields or VIP lounges to thrive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Headbangers Boat earned credibility by staying focused. No genre tourism. No pop crossover experiments. Just metal, presented the way it should be \u2014 loud, sweaty, and unfiltered.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Happens Onboard</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Between sets, the ship stays alive. Expect artist Q&amp;As, DJ sets (including spins from Lamb of God\u2019s Art Cruz), podcast recordings, fan events, merch chaos, and late-night bar conversations that turn strangers into lifelong allies. Halloween costumes take things further \u2014 because subtlety was never part of the deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tickets, Cabins &amp; How to Go</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cabins are limited and this cruise historically sells fast. Full details, cabin options, and official booking are available via the <a href=\"https://www.headbangersboat.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Headbangers Boat official site</a>. Keep an eye on ticket partners and affiliates as availability tightens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re going, pack smart. Sun, salt, pits, and sleep deprivation are part of the experience. Grab <a href=\"https://amzn.to/49OB60j\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">earplugs</a> now \u2014 you\u2019ll thank yourself later.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Is Headbangers Boat Worth It?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you love extreme music, community, and controlled chaos \u2014 yes, absolutely. If you need quiet mornings, early bedtimes, or polite applause, look elsewhere. Headbangers Boat isn\u2019t a vacation. It\u2019s a commitment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the right crowd, though, it\u2019s unforgettable. Miss it, and you\u2019ll hear about it for years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lineup includes:</strong> Lamb of God, Zakk Sabbath, The Dillinger Escape Plan, In Flames, GWAR, The Haunted, Death Angel, All Shall Perish, Kylesa, D.R.I., Harm\u2019s Way, Soilent Green, 200 Stab Wounds, Chained Saint, X-Cops, Mark Morton Band, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"819\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/26_log_lineup_1080x1350_ccfa7656fd141646f855288b4b6e09a2-819x1024.webp\" alt=\"Headbangers Boat 2026 lineup poster featuring Lamb of God, Zakk Sabbath, The Dillinger Escape Plan, In Flames, GWAR, and more on a dark skull-themed background\" class=\"wp-image-3448\" srcset=\"https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/26_log_lineup_1080x1350_ccfa7656fd141646f855288b4b6e09a2-819x1024.webp 819w, https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/26_log_lineup_1080x1350_ccfa7656fd141646f855288b4b6e09a2-240x300.webp 240w, https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/26_log_lineup_1080x1350_ccfa7656fd141646f855288b4b6e09a2-768x960.webp 768w, https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/26_log_lineup_1080x1350_ccfa7656fd141646f855288b4b6e09a2.webp 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tickets:</strong> <a href=\"https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3DHeadbangers%20Boat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Get Headbangers Boat tickets on Ticketmaster</a></p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>The metal and hard rock world doesn\u2019t slow down\u2014New tours are locking in, festivals are stacking lineups that demand attention, cruise ships are once again being turned into floating pits, and longtime icons are reminding everyone what survival really looks like. At the same time, the scene is forced to confront uncomfortable truths when headlines turn dark. This is one of those weeks where everything hits at once. Catch more in the <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/\">latest Rundown</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bush Announce Spring 2026 U.S. Tour With Mammoth and James And The Cold Gun</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bush are officially back on the road in a big way. The band announced a Spring 2026 U.S. tour kicking off April 7 in Pittsburgh, pairing them with Mammoth\u2014Wolfgang Van Halen\u2019s ever-growing hard rock juggernaut\u2014and rising UK rock outfit James And The Cold Gun. It\u2019s a lineup that bridges eras without feeling forced, and that matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This tour feels calculated in the right way. Mammoth bring modern relevance and genuine musicianship, while James And The Cold Gun add a raw, hungry energy that keeps the package from feeling too polished. Bush, meanwhile, remain a reminder that <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/alternative-metal/\">alternative metal</a>\u2019s crossover moment still has teeth when delivered with conviction.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">John Bush Revives Anthrax-Era Material at Milwaukee Metal Festival 2026</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>John Bush performing <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/anthrax/\">Anthrax</a>-era material live isn\u2019t just a nostalgia grab\u2014it\u2019s a long-overdue acknowledgment of a divisive but important chapter in the band\u2019s history. Bush is set to deliver songs from his tenure with Anthrax at Milwaukee Metal Festival 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Bush-era albums were heavier, darker, and leaned harder into <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/thrash-metal/\">thrash metal</a> and groove than many fans wanted to admit at the time. Years later, those records hit harder than the arguments ever did.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Headbangers Boat 2026 Finalizes Lineup for Lamb Of God\u2013Led Voyage</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Headbangers Boat has officially locked in its 2026 lineup, led by <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/lamb-of-god/\">Lamb Of God</a> and joined by Death Angel, All Shall Perish, Kylesa, and more. It\u2019s a brutal roster rooted in groove metal and modern extreme sounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn\u2019t poolside background noise. Headbangers Boat continues to book bands that actually make sense together, turning the cruise into a floating extension of the pit rather than a novelty vacation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Former Fire From The Gods Vocalist AJ Channer Arrest Record Comes to Light</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Arrest records involving former Fire From The Gods vocalist AJ Channer surfaced this week, detailing charges related to child endangerment. It\u2019s serious, deeply uncomfortable, and not something the scene can shrug off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When stories like this break, accountability matters more than brand loyalty. The metal world prides itself on honesty\u2014especially when that honesty forces hard conversations.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Rob Halford Celebrates 40 Years Sober: A Milestone Worth Respect</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Halford of <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/judas-priest/\">Judas Priest</a> marked an incredible milestone this week: 40 years sober. In a genre long tied to excess, this achievement stands as a reminder that survival is its own kind of rebellion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Halford\u2019s longevity in <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/heavy-metal/\">heavy metal</a> isn\u2019t just about iconic vocals or leather-and-studs imagery\u2014it\u2019s about endurance. Four decades sober is monumental, and it deserves respect from every corner of the metal community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More from Metal Mantra:</strong> <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/headbangers-boat-2026-lineup/\">Headbangers Boat 2026</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/\">Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026</a></p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Black Veil Brides have officially opened 2026 with a goddamn statement. The band\u2019s new single \u201cCertainty\u201d and its blistering video are out now \u2014 and they\u2019re way more than another pretty rock anthem. More reviews: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/review/\">Review hub</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cCertainty\u201d is the first real blood pumping from the veins of the BVB machine this year, and it smacks. Brooding riffs, Andy Biersack tearing through vocals like he\u2019s pissed off at the universe, and a visual that\u2019s as gritty and strange as that teaser with the goat and the hole he was digging. It\u2019s a fresh chapter but it still feels unmistakably <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/black-veil-brides/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/black-veil-brides/\">Black Veil Brides</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The song is slated for the band\u2019s upcoming seventh album on Spinefarm later in 2026, and if this is any indication of what\u2019s coming, we\u2019re in for a bruising ride. Andy says the concept of certainty \u2014 that stubborn, close-minded prison of thought \u2014 is at the core of the record. It\u2019s heavy in both theme and tone, inspired by the film <em>Conclave</em>, and it wears that influence on its sleeve without being pretentious about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The official video, shot in Bogot\u00e1 and directed by George Gallardo Kattah, stitches together eerie performance footage with cinematic storytelling that makes a lot of the cookie-cutter Rock visuals look like amateur hour. It\u2019s cinematic without being overproduced \u2014 hell, it\u2019s one of the better BVB visuals in years.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Black Veil Brides - Certainty\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Dk9DI5C4Ss?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>STREAM \u201cCERTAINTY\u201d \u00bb</strong> <a href=\"https://blackveilbrides.lnk.to/Certainty\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://blackveilbrides.lnk.to/Certainty</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019ve been sniping at BVB for \u201cselling out\u201d or \u201cgoing soft,\u201d shut up and listen first. Black Veil Brides are no strangers to controversy or reinvention, and with \u201cCertainty,\u201d the band continue to evolve \u2014 adding another chapter to their long, divisive history in modern metal. This is neither radio fluff nor another recycled emo-anthem. It\u2019s a band with real chops pushing a dark concept and \u2014 no BS \u2014 nearly pulling it off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What makes \u201cCertainty\u201d hit harder is that it doesn\u2019t feel like a throwaway single or a label-mandated warm-up. This sounds like a thesis statement. If this track really is the emotional spine of the upcoming album, Black Veil Brides are leaning into darker questions instead of easy answers \u2014 and that\u2019s a smart move in a scene that often plays it safe. Whether fans embrace it or argue about it for weeks, that tension is the point. Expect more details on the full album soon. For now, dive in, argue with your friends about it, and try not to get this riff stuck in your head.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/38bc0620-36a2-f347-2cce-8e072d2b4d52-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Dark red album artwork showing a skeletal figure sitting upright in a bed surrounded by candles and heavy red curtains, with the Black Veil Brides logo and the word \u201cCertainty.\u201d\" class=\"wp-image-3428\" srcset=\"https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/38bc0620-36a2-f347-2cce-8e072d2b4d52-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/38bc0620-36a2-f347-2cce-8e072d2b4d52-300x300.jpg 300w, https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/38bc0620-36a2-f347-2cce-8e072d2b4d52-150x150.jpg 150w, https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/38bc0620-36a2-f347-2cce-8e072d2b4d52-768x768.jpg 768w, https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/38bc0620-36a2-f347-2cce-8e072d2b4d52.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n<p><strong>Listen/Buy:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Black+Veil+Brides+Drop+%E2%80%9CCertainty%E2%80%9D+and+It+Hits+Harder+Than+You%E2%80%99d+Expect&#038;tag=metalmantra-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Find on Amazon</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More from Metal Mantra:</strong> <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/\">Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026</a></p>\n",

    "content": "\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">This Week\u2019s Upcoming Metal &amp; Hard Rock Releases \u2014 January 9, 2026</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The release calendar doesn\u2019t ease into 2026 \u2014 it kicks the door off the hinges. This week brings arena-ready hard rock, symphonic firepower, hardcore brutality, and more than a few curveballs from the underground. Here\u2019s what\u2019s landing and why it matters. More metal news: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/news/\">News hub</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Alter Bridge \u2014 <em>Alter Bridge</em> (Napalm Records)</strong><br>\nAlter Bridge double down on their legacy with a self-titled release that feels intentional, heavy, and built for longevity. Myles Kennedy sounds locked in, Tremonti\u2019s riffs hit with confidence, and the band leans into what they do best without chasing trends. This is polished, muscular hard rock done right \u2014 the kind of record that lives on turntables, not playlists.  \n<br><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4jtj1bj\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noopener\">Buy Alter Bridge \u2013 Alter Bridge on Amazon</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Beyond The Black \u2014 <em>Break The Silence</em> (Nuclear Blast)</strong><br>\nBeyond The Black continue their ascent with an album that blends cinematic symphonic metal with modern hard rock hooks. <em>Break The Silence</em> leans emotional without losing weight, pairing orchestral drama with riffs that actually bite. This one\u2019s designed for fans who want melody without sacrificing power.  \n<br><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4aMzANf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noopener\">Buy Beyond The Black \u2013 Break The Silence on Amazon</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bruit \u2014 <em>Monolith</em> (Re-Release, Pelagic Records)</strong><br>\nThe re-release of <em>Monolith</em> gives Bruit\u2019s towering post-metal opus another moment in the spotlight. Dense, atmospheric, and patient, this record thrives on slow builds and crushing payoff. If you missed it the first time, now\u2019s your chance to experience one of the heavier mood pieces of recent years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bullet \u2014 <em>Kickstarter</em> (Steamhammer)</strong><br>\nBullet keep the engine running hot with a straight-shooting heavy metal record that favors grit over gloss. <em>Kickstarter</em> is all momentum \u2014 fast riffs, no-frills choruses, and a classic metal backbone that refuses to age out. Simple, loud, effective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Iotunn \u2014 <em>Waves Over Copenhell</em> (Metal Blade Records)</strong><br>\nCaptured live and unleashed without mercy, <em>Waves Over Copenhell</em> showcases Iotunn at their most punishing. Blackened doom textures collide with towering atmospheres, making this less a live album and more a ritual recording. Cold, overwhelming, and immersive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>L\u00e4j\u00e4 \u00c4ij\u00e4l\u00e4 &amp; Albert Witchfinder \u2014 <em>Circle Of Pain</em> (Svart Records)</strong><br>\nThis collaboration drags punk venom through a swamp of doom and occult heaviness. <em>Circle Of Pain</em> feels confrontational and unpolished by design, leaning into discomfort rather than accessibility. Not for casual listening \u2014 and that\u2019s the point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lionheart \u2014 <em>Valley Of Death II</em> (Arising Empire)</strong><br>\nLionheart don\u2019t reinvent themselves \u2014 they sharpen the blade. <em>Valley Of Death II</em> is aggressive, direct, and engineered for the pit. Every riff swings like a hammer, every vocal line dares you to stand still. Hardcore with purpose and zero filler.  \n<br><a href=\"https://amzn.to/49tN4v3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noopener\">Buy Lionheart \u2013 Valley Of Death II on Amazon</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Medea Project \u2014 <em>Live At Dingwalls</em> (Self-Released)</strong><br>\nRaw and unfiltered, <em>Live At Dingwalls</em> captures The Medea Project in their natural habitat \u2014 loud, chaotic, and emotionally charged. The imperfections work in its favor, making this feel like a document rather than a product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nanowar Of Steel \u2014 <em>The Genghis Khan EP To End All Genghis Khan EPs</em> (Napalm Records)</strong><br>\nNanowar Of Steel continue walking the fine line between parody and legitimately good metal. The jokes land, the riffs hit harder than expected, and the EP fully commits to its ridiculous premise. It\u2019s dumb on purpose \u2014 and executed with skill.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Push! \u2014 <em>Plowing Ahead</em> (Frozen Records)</strong><br>\nModern aggression meets forward motion on <em>Plowing Ahead</em>. Push! deliver groove-heavy heaviness with a sharp edge, favoring momentum and punch over excess polish. A solid pick for fans of contemporary metal that still sweats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Semper Acerbus \u2014 <em>Following Omens</em> (Eclipse Records)</strong><br>\nBleak, deliberate, and oppressive, <em>Following Omens</em> leans fully into doom\u2019s suffocating embrace. This is slow-burn heaviness meant to linger, not entertain. Best consumed in one sitting, at maximum volume.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Six Going On Seven \u2014 <em>Human Tears</em> (Spartan Records)</strong><br>\nEmotionally raw and musically abrasive, <em>Human Tears</em> balances catharsis and chaos. Screamo in its purest form \u2014 frantic, heartfelt, and unconcerned with polish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Uuhai \u2014 <em>Human Herds</em> (Napalm Records)</strong><br>\nUuhai blur folk ritual and black metal ferocity into something primal and unsettling. <em>Human Herds</em> thrives on rhythm and atmosphere, pulling the listener into a trance that feels ancient and confrontational.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Featured Physical Releases This Week</strong><br>\n\u2022 <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4jtj1bj\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noopener\">Alter Bridge \u2013 <em>Alter Bridge</em></a><br>\n\u2022 <a href=\"https://amzn.to/4aMzANf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noopener\">Beyond The Black \u2013 <em>Break The Silence</em></a><br>\n\u2022 <a href=\"https://amzn.to/49tN4v3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noopener\">Lionheart \u2013 <em>Valley Of Death II</em></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>More Metal Mantra: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/\">Rundowns</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-metal-tracks-of-2025/\">Top 10 Metal Tracks of 2025</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Listen/Buy:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=New+Metal+%26amp%3B+Hard+Rock+Albums+++January+9%2C+2026&#038;tag=metalmantra-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Find on Amazon</a></p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>The metal and hard rock world is doing what it does best right now \u2014 colliding eras, genres, and uncomfortable truths all at once. <strong>Metal Mantra</strong> is tracking it all, and today\u2019s <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/metal-news/\">metal news</a> rundown is a reminder that this scene only stays alive when it refuses to behave. Legacy bands are pushing boundaries instead of polishing memories, festivals are doubling down on scale and chaos, and a couple of long-simmering truths finally got said out loud. Catch more in the <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/\">latest Rundown</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Guns N\u2019 Roses kicked the hornet\u2019s nest first, unveiling a completely unhinged list of openers for select dates on their 2026 North American tour. Public Enemy. Ice Cube. The Black Crowes. Pierce The Veil. That lineup isn\u2019t about cohesion \u2014 it\u2019s about confrontation. GNR have never thrived by staying comfortable, and this feels like Axl daring the crowd to remember that rock was always supposed to make people uneasy. If this pisses off the gatekeepers, good. They\u2019ve been too comfortable for too long.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Across the Atlantic, Dublin showed exactly how a city treats its icons. Fans packed the 3Arena for the massive Phil Lynott tribute, turning the night into something closer to a communal reckoning than a standard celebration. Thin Lizzy\u2019s songs still hit because they were written from real places \u2014 ambition, loneliness, swagger, doubt \u2014 and that honesty doesn\u2019t expire. Seeing an all-star lineup honor Lynott on home soil proved once again that <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/thin-lizzy/\">Thin Lizzy</a> isn\u2019t just part of Irish music history. It\u2019s part of the city\u2019s spine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reunions can be dangerous territory, but Triumph seem intent on doing this one the right way. Drummer Gil Moore confirmed the band\u2019s 2026 shows will feature full sets from both him and Rik Emmett, with Phil X joining the lineup. No shortcuts. No trimmed-down nostalgia sets. Triumph always prided themselves on musicianship, and this feels like a reminder that they still expect to earn their spot onstage \u2014 not be handed it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Download Festival continues to act like the gravitational center of heavy music in Europe. The first wave of over 90 bands for Download 2026, led by Limp Bizkit, Guns N\u2019 Roses, and Linkin Park, is pure Donington excess \u2014 loud, divisive, and impossible to ignore. Download understands that metal culture isn\u2019t about linear progression or purity tests. It\u2019s about shared moments, emotional release, and sometimes absolute chaos. This lineup checks all those boxes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not everything in today\u2019s news is celebratory, though. Faith No More keyboardist Roddy Bottum reflecting on the band\u2019s early \u201990s touring with Guns N\u2019 Roses cuts straight through the nostalgia fog. Calling the experience \u201coffensive\u201d isn\u2019t revisionism \u2014 it\u2019s honesty. That environment became a catalyst for Bottum reclaiming himself and eventually coming out, a reminder that the road wasn\u2019t always safe just because the crowds were massive. Sometimes success came with damage attached.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jake E. Lee\u2019s latest comments on the never-ending \u201cBark at the Moon\u201d writing-credit saga land with similar weight. Contracts over creativity. Power over truth. One accidental admission changing decades of narrative. It\u2019s an ugly side of the business that fans don\u2019t like to think about, but it\u2019s baked into the history of heavy music whether anyone wants to admit it or not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s the thread tying today together. Metal doesn\u2019t survive by pretending the past was perfect or the future will be tidy. It survives by confronting both head-on, amps blazing. Stick with <strong>Metal Mantra</strong>. We\u2019re here for the mess \u2014 because that\u2019s where the truth usually lives.</p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>The calendar flipped, the hangovers here, and metal wasted no time reminding everyone that the scene never actually sleeps. While the rest of the world was busy pretending January 1 means a clean slate, heavy music came out swinging \u2014 unresolved drama, veteran perspective, underground reunions, and a tour announcement that reads like a concussion protocol. This is where things stand right now. Catch more in the <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/\">latest Rundown</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Nick Pierce Breaks His Silence on As I Lay Dying \u2014 and It\u2019s Not Pretty</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After months of speculation and side-eye from fans, As I Lay Dying drummer Nick Pierce finally said the quiet part out loud. According to Pierce, the band gave Tim Lambesis a legitimate second chance \u2014 not a PR stunt, not a half-measure \u2014 and he still managed to blow it. No dramatic framing. No sympathy fishing. Just a blunt acknowledgment that the trust extended to Lambesis wasn\u2019t respected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What makes Pierce\u2019s comments hit harder is how grounded they feel. This wasn\u2019t an emotional outburst or a scorched-earth rant. It sounded like someone who\u2019s already processed the disappointment and moved on. As I Lay Dying\u2019s post-prison era was always going to be fragile, and Pierce\u2019s words confirm what many suspected: the collapse wasn\u2019t sudden, and it wasn\u2019t unfair. The band tried to rebuild. The foundation cracked anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Metal forgives a lot. But it doesn\u2019t forget patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Dave Mustaine Explains Why Megadeth Covered \u201cRide the Lightning\u201d</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Somewhere around the point where time humbles everyone, Dave Mustaine started speaking about Metallica like a historian instead of a rival. In explaining why Megadeth covered \u201cRide the Lightning,\u201d Mustaine cut through decades of mythology and simply called it what it is: \u201ca hell of a song.\u201d No qualifiers. No backhanded compliments. Just respect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The choice makes sense. \u201cRide the Lightning\u201d isn\u2019t just a Metallica track \u2014 it\u2019s a structural beam in thrash metal itself. Mustaine knows that better than anyone. This isn\u2019t Megadeth chasing relevance or playing nice for headlines. It\u2019s a veteran acknowledging a moment that shaped an entire genre, including his own career. If anything, the lack of bitterness says more than any reconciliation narrative ever could.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Megadeth\u2019s Farewell Still Has Teeth \u2014 and an Exit Plan</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside the Metallica talk, Mustaine once again addressed Megadeth\u2019s eventual farewell \u2014 and made it clear this isn\u2019t going to devolve into a parody of itself. In his words, they\u2019re not about to \u201cCr\u00fce-it-up\u201d with endless goodbye tours and convenient reversals. It was said plainly, and it landed exactly how it was meant to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether fans want to believe it or not, Megadeth\u2019s exit strategy sounds deliberate. There\u2019s no illusion that the band will disappear overnight, but Mustaine seems intent on closing the book with intention instead of dragging the story out for diminishing returns. In a scene where legacy acts often overstay their welcome, that restraint might end up being the most metal move of all.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Former Mushroomhead Members Reunite as The Ex-Faces</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mushroomhead\u2019s long and messy lineage took another turn this week with the announcement that six former members will reunite for two April shows under the name The Ex-Faces. Flint and Columbus will host the performances \u2014 which feels intentional, not random. These cities know the history. They lived it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn\u2019t a reunion tour or a rebrand. It\u2019s a pressure release. Years of lineup fractures, legal nonsense, and creative detours finally boil down to a couple of nights where the music gets to exist without footnotes. For fans who fell off somewhere along Mushroomhead\u2019s endless internal reshuffling, The Ex-Faces might feel less like nostalgia and more like closure.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Chaos &amp; Carnage 2026 Loads the Weapon</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If subtlety was on your New Year\u2019s resolution list, Chaos &amp; Carnage 2026 is here to ruin it. Thy Art Is Murder will headline the touring extreme-metal pile-on, backed by Carnifex, Bodysnatcher, 200 Stab Wounds, Ingested, and a lineup designed to leave venues structurally compromised.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This tour has never pretended to be anything other than overwhelming, and 2026 looks no different. Thy Art Is Murder sitting at the top is a logical choice \u2014 precise, ruthless, and fully uninterested in accessibility. Chaos &amp; Carnage remains a reminder that heavy music didn\u2019t get softer just because the internet got louder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Chaos &amp; Carnage 2026 tickets:</strong> Dates are live and some stops will sell out \u2014 <a href=\"https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dchaos%2Band%2Bcarnage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow sponsored noopener\">grab tickets here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>New year or not, the message is the same: metal isn\u2019t slowing down, and it\u2019s not asking permission.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Related: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/metal-hard-rock-news-february-25-2026-hall-of-fame-nods-ghost-hiatus-and-better-lovers-split/\">Metal &#038; Hard Rock News \u2013 February 25, 2026: Hall of Fame Nods, Ghost Hiatus, and Better Lovers Split</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/metal-hard-rock-news-february-23-2026/\">Metal &#038; Hard Rock News \u2013 February 23, 2026: Tour Turbulence, Fresh Tracks, and Festival Adds</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>More Metal Mantra: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/\">Rundowns</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tours/\">Metal Tours</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More from Metal Mantra:</strong> <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/\">Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026</a></p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>The year is crawling toward the finish line, but the metal world clearly didn\u2019t get the memo to slow down. Lineup shake-ups, long-simmering comeback whispers, experimental veterans refusing to stay predictable, and yet another reminder that scenes still have reckoning to do \u2014 it\u2019s all hitting at once. This isn\u2019t end-of-year filler. This is the sound of bands repositioning, recalibrating, and in some cases, ripping the bandage clean off. Catch more in the <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/\">latest Rundown</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Veil of Maya part ways with Lukas Magyar during hiatus</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4q1qv8d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Veil of Maya</a> have quietly but firmly closed the book on an era. Vocalist Lukas Magyar has officially exited the band during their current hiatus, confirming that he\u2019s moving on and placing his full creative focus on <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/sifyn/\">Sifyn</a>. No public blowup. No messy social media warfare. Just a clean break \u2014 and honestly, that might be the most surprising part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Magyar\u2019s tenure with Veil of Maya marked a massive stylistic pivot for the band, pulling them further into melody-heavy, modern metalcore territory while still clinging to their technical roots. It worked. It also split opinions, depending on how allergic you are to clean vocals. Either way, his voice became inseparable from the band\u2019s identity over the last decade, which makes this departure feel heavier than the low-profile announcement suggests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The timing raises eyebrows. A hiatus exit always does. It suggests creative divergence rather than sudden chaos \u2014 a slow realization that the road ahead no longer runs parallel. With Sifyn now clearly his priority, Magyar seems ready to build something without the weight of legacy expectations. As for Veil of Maya, they\u2019re once again staring down reinvention. It\u2019s familiar territory for them, but that doesn\u2019t make it any less risky.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Disturbed start teasing new music, because of course they do</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Just when it seemed like 2025 was finally running out of gas, <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/disturbed/\">Disturbed</a> decided to light a match. After a relatively quiet stretch, the band has begun teasing new music, setting the internet into its usual cycle of speculation, hope, dread, and meme generation. Love them or roll your eyes at them, Disturbed still know exactly how to flip the switch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn\u2019t a band that operates on accident. Every tease is calculated, every breadcrumb dropped with full awareness of the reaction it\u2019ll trigger. Disturbed occupy a strange space in modern metal \u2014 too heavy for mainstream rock purists, too accessible for extreme metal diehards, and completely unbothered by either camp\u2019s approval. That stubborn middle ground has kept them commercially massive, even when critical opinion wavers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bigger question isn\u2019t whether new Disturbed material will land, but what version of the band shows up. Another polished, arena-ready sledgehammer? A darker, more aggressive turn? Or something designed to start arguments all over again? Whatever it is, they\u2019re not teasing unless there\u2019s something ready to hit hard. 2025 clearly isn\u2019t done swinging.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ulver announce <em>Neverland</em>, because staying still has never been the point</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/ulver/\">Ulver</a> have announced a new album titled <em>Neverland</em>, set to arrive digitally on December 31, with physical editions following on February 27, 2026. The first glimpse comes via the track \u201cWeeping Stone,\u201d and in true Ulver fashion, it\u2019s less about immediate gratification and more about atmosphere, unease, and slow-burning intent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a band that stopped caring about genre boundaries decades ago. From their black metal origins to orchestral soundscapes, electronic experiments, and cinematic gloom, Ulver have treated reinvention as a core philosophy rather than a marketing angle. <em>Neverland</em> already feels positioned as another chapter in that refusal to repeat themselves \u2014 music for listeners who prefer tension over hooks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Releasing digitally at the very edge of the year feels intentional, almost defiant. No hype cycle bloat. No festival-season alignment. Just new music dropped into the void, waiting for the right ears to find it. Ulver don\u2019t chase trends. They let time catch up to them instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bilmuri split with touring guitarist Reese Maslen following abuse allegations</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/bilmuri/\">Bilmuri</a> have parted ways with touring guitarist Reese Maslen following serious abuse allegations, making the split immediate. The band\u2019s statement was brief and direct, leaving little room for ambiguity. In a scene that\u2019s spent years learning \u2014 sometimes the hard way \u2014 how to respond to these situations, the move was swift and decisive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s no spectacle here, and there doesn\u2019t need to be. Abuse allegations don\u2019t require fan debates, conspiracy threads, or performative outrage. They require action. Bilmuri made theirs clear, prioritizing distance and accountability over damage control or silence. That shouldn\u2019t be notable \u2014 but history says it still is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For fans, it\u2019s another uncomfortable reminder that talent doesn\u2019t exist in a vacuum, and being part of a band doesn\u2019t grant immunity from consequences. The hope is that moments like this slowly shift expectations across the scene. Less tolerance. Less enabling. Less pretending it\u2019s someone else\u2019s problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More from Metal Mantra:</strong> <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/\">Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026</a></p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>If you thought the holidays were going to slow things down in the metal world, think again. The riffs never sleep, and neither does the drama. From legacy thrash beef boiling over in public, to glam-era eccentricity cranked to cartoonish levels, to another classic reunion story ending exactly how you\u2019d expect \u2014 here\u2019s the latest from the loud side of the internet. Catch more in the <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/\">latest Rundown</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vio-Lence drama spills out in public as Sean Killian calls Phil Demmel \u201cselfish.\u201d</strong> What\u2019s been simmering behind closed doors finally boiled over this week, and honestly, no one should be surprised. Vio-Lence has been stuck in a frustrating limbo for a while now \u2014 a band with momentum, goodwill, and a fanbase ready to rage, yet constantly hitting the brakes. Vocalist Sean Killian finally said the quiet part out loud, pointing the finger squarely at guitarist Phil Demmel and accusing him of putting personal priorities ahead of the band.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Killian didn\u2019t mince words. The accusation of \u201cselfishness\u201d cuts deep in a genre built on loyalty and shared sacrifice, especially when fans have already been burned by false starts and half-commitments. Demmel\u2019s post-Machine Head schedule has always been crowded, and while no one begrudges a musician staying busy, there\u2019s a point where side projects turn into roadblocks. This isn\u2019t just internal band politics \u2014 it\u2019s another reminder that legacy <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/thrash-metal\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/thrash-metal\">thrash bands</a> live or die on follow-through. You can\u2019t tease the pit and then ghost it. Fans notice. And eventually, they stop waiting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vinnie Vincent doubles down on his $200\u2013$300 CD single price tag.</strong> Yes, you read that right. One song. Hundreds of dollars. And no, Vinnie Vincent is not backing down. The former Kiss guitarist has doubled, tripled, and basically fire-bombed any criticism over the pricing of his new CD single \u201cRide The Serpent,\u201d insisting that the track is worth more than most full albums released today. In typical Vincent fashion, the logic exists in its own universe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s the thing: if anyone was going to pull something like this, it was always going to be Vinnie. He\u2019s never played by industry rules, and at this point, he\u2019s not even pretending to acknowledge them. For hardcore collectors, diehards, and those who treat Vincent\u2019s output like sacred artifacts, the price might not be a dealbreaker. For everyone else, it\u2019s pure spectacle \u2014 rock star ego turned into a luxury product. Whether this is bold artistic valuation or pure delusion depends on how much nostalgia you\u2019re willing to monetize. Either way, it\u2019s peak Vinnie Vincent, and pretending otherwise would be dishonest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Don Dokken reflects on the \u201cdisaster\u201d 2016 reunion tour.</strong> If you\u2019ve followed Dokken for more than five minutes, you already know how this story ends. Still, hearing Don Dokken describe the 2016 reunion tour as a \u201cdisaster\u201d hits with a mix of honesty and exhaustion. The classic lineup reunion was supposed to be a victory lap \u2014 a chance to put old grudges aside and give fans what they\u2019d been asking for since the \u201980s. Instead, it became another cautionary tale about unresolved baggage and incompatible personalities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Don, the problems weren\u2019t just musical \u2014 they were personal, structural, and deeply ingrained. Decades-old resentment doesn\u2019t magically disappear just because ticket sales look good on paper. He\u2019s realistic about it now, admitting that another full reunion feels unlikely, and frankly, that might be the healthiest take anyone involved has had in years. Not every band is built to age gracefully. Some are meant to burn bright, implode, and leave behind records that outlive the drama. Dokken already earned its place in hard rock history. Forcing nostalgia to cooperate rarely ends well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Metal never runs out of stories \u2014 it just changes the volume knob. Whether it\u2019s thrash veterans clashing over commitment, glam icons turning scarcity into currency, or classic bands confronting the limits of reunion culture, the scene keeps reminding us why it\u2019s never boring. Loud, flawed, opinionated, and occasionally ridiculous \u2014 just the way we like it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

    "content": "\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Top 10 Upcoming Metal, Metalcore, Deathcore &amp; Hardcore Albums of 2026</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s be honest \u2014 2026 is already looking like one of <em>those</em> years. The kind where release calendars get circled in Sharpie, group chats blow up at midnight drops, and everyone suddenly remembers why heavy music still matters when the world feels sideways. Thrash legends are closing chapters, modern metal giants are doubling down, and the next wave of core bands are stepping up with something to prove. This isn\u2019t hype for hype\u2019s sake. These are records that will actually move the needle. More metal news: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/news/\">News hub</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s Metal Mantra\u2019s locked-in list of the <strong>Top 10 confirmed metal, metalcore, deathcore, and hardcore albums coming in 2026</strong> \u2014 the ones worth your time, your money, and your neck pain.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Megadeth \u2014 <em>Megadeth</em></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is it. The final chapter. Dave Mustaine has made it clear this self-titled album is Megadeth\u2019s last full-length, and everything we\u2019ve heard so far sounds like a band determined to go out swinging. No nostalgia tour cash-in. No soft landing. Just sharp riffs, venom in the vocals, and a very intentional middle finger to time itself. If this really is the end, Megadeth chose violence \u2014 and that\u2019s exactly how it should be. <strong><em>Jan. 23</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3LeAmIx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pre-order Megadeth on vinyl</a> | <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/1Yox196W7bzVNZI7RBaPnf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Spotify</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/megadeth/\">Metal Mantra archive</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Anthrax \u2014 <em>TBA</em></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ten years is a long damn time between albums \u2014 and Anthrax know it. Everything surrounding this release screams pent-up energy. They\u2019ve taken their time, tuned out the noise, and supposedly delivered something that justifies the wait. Expect classic New York thrash with modern bite, zero trend-chasing, and that unmistakable Anthrax bounce that still wrecks pits decades later. If you forgot how fun thrash can be, this record is here to remind you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Kreator \u2014 <em>Krushers of the World</em></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Kreator don\u2019t miss anymore. Period. <em>Krushers of the World</em> continues their late-career hot streak \u2014 massive hooks, militant aggression, and Mille Petrozza sounding like he\u2019s permanently wired into a global unrest frequency. This isn\u2019t retro thrash cosplay. This is a band aging like warheads, not wine.<strong><em> Jan. 16</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4b67We8\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://amzn.to/4b67We8\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored\">Order on vinyl</a> | <a href=\"https://www.nuclearblast.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nuclear Blast</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Exodus \u2014 <em>TBA</em></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Dukes is back. That alone tells you everything you need to know. Exodus aren\u2019t chasing relevance \u2014 they\u2019re reclaiming brutality. Early word points to an album stacked with anthems, pit fuel, and riffs that sound like they were written to break concrete floors. If you miss ugly, violent thrash that smells like beer and bad decisions, this one\u2019s for you. <strong><em>March 20</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Converge \u2014 <em>Love Is Not Enough</em></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Converge don\u2019t release albums \u2014 they release emotional blunt-force trauma. <em>Love Is Not Enough</em> reportedly escalates from start to finish, and knowing this band, that means no relief, no clean exits, and no apologies. Hardcore kids will cry. Metalcore kids will pretend they don\u2019t. Everyone loses their voice anyway. <strong><em>Feb. 13</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Gojira \u2014 <em>TBA</em></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After dominating arenas and award stages, Gojira are reportedly steering back toward heavier waters. Fewer pleasantries. Bigger riffs. More pressure. If this really leans closer to their earlier, more punishing sound, expect a record that shuts up anyone who accused them of going soft. Gojira don\u2019t retreat \u2014 they recalibrate.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Motionless In White \u2014 <em>TBA</em></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Twenty years deep and somehow still growing. This album is being framed as a full-circle moment \u2014 old influences, modern polish, and zero interest in shrinking themselves. Motionless In White know exactly who they are, and that confidence bleeds through every breakdown and hook. Expect big choruses, darker edges, and a band fully comfortable being one of modern metal\u2019s standard-bearers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. Ice Nine Kills \u2014 <em>TBA</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If this is truly the final chapter of <em>The Silver Scream</em> era, Ice Nine Kills are going to make it count. Bigger production. Sharper writing. Still absurdly theatrical. Love them or hate them, nobody in metalcore understands branding, momentum, and spectacle better right now. Expect another album that dominates playlists and festival stages whether purists like it or not.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9. Slipknot \u2014 <em>Look Outside Your Window</em></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This one\u2019s weird \u2014 and that\u2019s the point. Recorded years ago, finally seeing daylight, and intentionally not a traditional Slipknot album, <em>Look Outside Your Window</em> is all atmosphere, mood, and experimental tension. No masks required. No expectations met. If you want chaos without blast beats, this might be the most interesting Slipknot-related release in years.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">10. Ov Sulfur \u2014 <em>Endless</em></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Deathcore isn\u2019t dead \u2014 it\u2019s just getting smarter. Ov Sulfur\u2019s <em>Endless</em> blends suffocating heaviness with unsettling melody, and it doesn\u2019t feel forced. It feels intentional. This is the sound of a band refusing to stay boxed in while still hitting like a wrecking ball. Pay attention now, or pretend you liked them later. <strong><em>Jan 16</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Rumored &amp; Anticipated (Keep These on Your Radar)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hatebreed</strong> are sitting on something nasty and fast, and if it drops in late 2026, expect zero evolution and zero mercy \u2014 just pure hardcore violence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Trivium</strong> are quietly circling their next move. If album #11 lands, it\u2019ll likely continue their recent streak of balancing old-school riff worship with modern precision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bullet For My Valentine</strong> are reportedly leaning heavier again. Whether that means <em>The Poison</em>-era callbacks or something sharper remains to be seen \u2014 but the intent is there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2026 isn\u2019t about nostalgia. It\u2019s about bands with something left to say \u2014 or something left to burn down. Either way, clear space on your shelf and brace your neck. This year is going to hurt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Listen/Buy:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Top+10+Upcoming+Metal+Albums+of+2026&#038;tag=metalmantra-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Find on Amazon</a></p>\n",

    "content": "<p><strong>Metal &amp; hard rock news</strong> doesn\u2019t move in a straight line \u2014 it lurches, collides, and occasionally implodes. Today\u2019s metal and hard rock news cycle captures that reality perfectly, stacking uncomfortable reckonings, career-defining victories, and full-circle moments that remind everyone why this scene still matters. Catch more in the <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/\">latest Rundown</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Coalesce</strong> stepping forward with an official statement addressing allegations involving guitarist Jes Steineger is one of those moments that demands attention instead of passive scrolling. This isn\u2019t gossip fodder or headline bait \u2014 it\u2019s a legacy band acknowledging real-world consequences inside a culture that too often avoids hard conversations. Coalesce have never been interested in being comfortable, and their response reflects that same confrontational honesty that defined their music.</p>\n<p>On the other end of the spectrum, <strong>Sleep Token</strong> hitting Gold status in the UK with <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4qqoORq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Even In Arcadia</a></em> feels like a seismic shift that\u2019s been building for years. This isn\u2019t industry luck or viral roulette \u2014 it\u2019s the result of a band refusing to dilute their identity while quietly pulling listeners from every corner of heavy and alternative music. Love them or loathe them, this milestone confirms Sleep Token aren\u2019t a moment. They\u2019re infrastructure now. Sleep Token\u2019s continued momentum shows no signs of slowing, with the band once again dominating headlines \u2014 a trend we\u2019ve been tracking closely in our ongoing <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/sleep-token/\" rel=\"internal\">Sleep Token coverage</a> here at Metal Mantra.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s be real \u2014 few bands command a festival stage like <strong>Slipknot</strong>, and the release of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/g5tXsoj-lx8?si=lIijbb6M-WThQX-o\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">full pro-shot footage</a> from their 2025 Resurrection Fest set proves it yet again. Ninety minutes of precision chaos, no filters, no apologies. This isn\u2019t nostalgia tourism. This is a band still operating at full force, reminding everyone why they remain a headliner wherever they land.</p>\n<p><strong>Gojira</strong> continue their slow but unstoppable ascent into global metal consciousness with fiery pro-shot footage of \u201cAh! \u00c7a Ira! (Mea Culpa)\u201d from Bloodstock 2025. There\u2019s something especially powerful about watching a French metal band channel revolutionary themes on a festival stage built on sweat and volume. It hits harder knowing the wider world has finally caught up to what metal fans have known for years.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"\u26a1 GOJIRA \u2013 Mea Culpa | Bloodstock 2025 Pro-Shot Live\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/v9sPSv4vDdw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<p>Then comes the gut punch of finality. <strong>Refused</strong> officially closing out their farewell run with a hometown performance isn\u2019t just another goodbye \u2014 it\u2019s the end of a chapter that reshaped hardcore\u2019s vocabulary. No reunion teases. No legacy padding. Just a hard stop from a band that always understood when to walk away. That kind of exit takes discipline, and it hurts because it\u2019s real.</p>\n<p>If today proves anything, it\u2019s that survival in heavy music is never guaranteed. <strong>VOLA</strong> launching a crowdfunder after losing nearly all their gear in a storage-facility fire is every touring band\u2019s nightmare realized. Entire infrastructure gone overnight. Years of work erased in smoke. This isn\u2019t drama \u2014 it\u2019s survival math. Moments like this are where scenes either show up or expose themselves.</p>\n<p>Metal &amp; hard rock don\u2019t exist in a vacuum. They live in tension \u2014 between accountability and triumph, endurance and collapse. Today\u2019s news cycle isn\u2019t neat or celebratory, but it\u2019s honest. And honesty, even when it\u2019s uncomfortable, is still the backbone of heavy music.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More from Metal Mantra:</strong> <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/\">Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-metal-tracks-of-2025/\">Top 10 Metal Tracks of 2025</a></p>\n",

    "title": "Lamb of God StubHub Flub",
    "content": "\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">StubHub Apologizes After Lamb of God Tickets Are Mistakenly Listed for Christian Concert</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>StubHub apologizes after Lamb of God tickets were mistakenly listed as a Christian concert</strong>, and the internet, predictably, lost its mind. What should have been a routine ticket listing for one of modern metal\u2019s most aggressive and uncompromising bands instead turned into a viral collision between heavy metal culture and contemporary Christian music \u2014 a mix-up so surreal it almost reads like satire. For Lamb of God fans and unsuspecting churchgoers alike, this wasn\u2019t just a clerical error; it was a perfect snapshot of how algorithm-driven ticketing systems collapse when metal news collides with mainstream automation. More metal news: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/news/\">News hub</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019ve been paying attention, Lamb of God don\u2019t exactly blur genre lines. The Richmond, Virginia metal titans have spent decades soundtracking mosh pits, festival chaos, and politically charged rage \u2014 not Sunday worship services. Yet in Spartanburg, South Carolina, StubHub briefly listed tickets for a Christian concert under Lamb of God\u2019s name, immediately igniting confusion across social media and raising eyebrows among anyone with even a surface-level understanding of metal culture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s be real \u2014 the phrase \u201cLamb of God\u201d has always carried dual meaning. Long before Randy Blythe ever grabbed a microphone, the term was deeply embedded in Christian theology. But in the heavy metal world, Lamb of God is synonymous with neck-snapping riffs, confrontational lyricism, and pit-level intensity. The fact that a major ticket reseller failed to distinguish between a Grammy-nominated metal band and a faith-based music event didn\u2019t just feel careless \u2014 it exposed how disconnected large platforms often are from the scenes they profit from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reaction was immediate and ruthless. Metal fans flooded comment sections with equal parts disbelief and dark humor as screenshots of the listing spread rapidly across platforms like X and Instagram. Jokes about blast beats echoing through church pews mixed with pointed reminders that Lamb of God once sparked protests and controversy \u2014 not praise choruses. It wasn\u2019t outrage so much as exhausted amusement, the kind metal fans reserve for yet another moment where the culture is misunderstood by the systems meant to serve it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>StubHub eventually issued a public apology, confirming the listing was incorrect and attributing the mistake to a data error caused by the shared name. Tickets were corrected, refunds were offered where applicable, and the company attempted to close the loop. But by then, the moment had already escaped containment. In the modern metal news cycle, even a brief digital slip becomes a lasting artifact \u2014 archived, memed, and dissected long after the correction is made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point, it\u2019s not exactly shocking. Ticket resellers rely on massive databases, scraped metadata, and automated categorization systems designed for speed and scale \u2014 not cultural nuance. Metal bands, especially those with symbolic or religiously loaded names, are frequent casualties of that approach. For Lamb of God, the mix-up feels less like an isolated mistake and more like a symptom of a live music ecosystem that still treats heavy metal as an edge case instead of a core genre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This incident also taps into a familiar frustration within the metal community. While pop, country, and mainstream rock are carefully segmented and curated, metal is often flattened into vague classifications or outright misfiled. That disconnect doesn\u2019t just result in awkward headlines \u2014 it affects ticket sales, fan trust, and how heavy music is represented to the broader public.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For fans planning to see Lamb of God live, the takeaway is straightforward: double-check listings and stick to verified sources. Supporting the band directly through officially licensed Lamb of God merch, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3MPT4qo\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://amzn.to/3MPT4qo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">physical media</a>, or confirmed tour announcements via <a href=\"https://www.lamb-of-god.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the band\u2019s official website</a> helps avoid the chaos that third-party resellers sometimes create.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Internally, this episode joins a growing list of strange, uniquely modern metal-world moments that Metal Mantra continues to track \u2014 from algorithm-fueled controversies to industry misfires that only seem to happen when heavy music is involved. You can stay locked into the stories that actually matter through our ongoing <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/category/metal-news/\">metal news coverage</a> and scene-focused reporting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the end, no one accidentally walked into a wall of death expecting a worship service \u2014 but for a brief moment, the internet was reminded how thin the line is between cultural literacy and automated guesswork. StubHub apologized, the listings were fixed, and metal moved on \u2014 but not without adding another absurd footnote to the ever-growing lore of heavy music in the digital age.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tickets:</strong> <a href=\"https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3DLamb%20of%20God%20StubHub%20Flub\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Get Lamb of God StubHub Flub tickets on Ticketmaster</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More from Metal Mantra:</strong> <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/headbangers-boat-2026-lineup/\">Headbangers Boat 2026</a></p>\n",

    "title": "Sleep Token Unlicensed Photo Merch",
    "content": "\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sleep Token Face Copyright Backlash Over Alleged Unlicensed Merch Photo Use</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sleep Token are facing renewed scrutiny after a photographer accused the band of using her live concert photo on official merchandise without permission</strong>, igniting a heated debate over copyright, creator rights, and how modern metal bands handle visual art in an era where merch is as valuable as music. More metal news: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/news/\">News hub</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019ve been paying attention, Sleep Token aren\u2019t just a band \u2014 they\u2019re a brand built on imagery, anonymity, and ritualistic presentation. That\u2019s precisely why this situation has struck such a nerve. According to the photographer, a photo she captured during Sleep Token\u2019s 2023 appearance at Denmark\u2019s Copenhell Festival was allegedly reproduced on a limited-edition ritual coin sold at the band\u2019s 2024 Frankfurt show, without her consent, license, or compensation. What should have been a moment of artistic recognition instead turned into a flashpoint about exploitation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s be real \u2014 live music photographers already operate on razor-thin margins. Access is limited, contracts are often vague, and the assumption that exposure is payment still poisons the industry. The accusation here isn\u2019t about fan reposts or social media sharing. It\u2019s about commercial merch \u2014 a physical product sold directly to fans for profit \u2014 and that distinction matters. When imagery crosses from documentation into monetization, licensing is no longer optional; it\u2019s foundational.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s made this story explode beyond typical music-industry drama is the context surrounding Sleep Token\u2019s previous copyright behavior. Earlier this year, tattoo artists and fan creators were hit with takedowns after producing Sleep Token\u2013inspired work. At the time, management defended the actions as necessary to protect the band\u2019s intellectual property. Now, with photographers stepping forward alleging unauthorized use of their work, the optics have flipped \u2014 and fans are noticing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point, the controversy isn\u2019t just about whether permission was granted. It\u2019s about communication \u2014 or the lack of it. The photographer claims attempts to resolve the issue privately went unanswered, forcing her to take the issue public. In metal culture, silence is often interpreted as guilt, and in a fanbase as hyper-engaged as Sleep Token\u2019s, that silence has only amplified speculation and frustration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most thorough breakdowns of the situation comes from <strong>Tank The Tech</strong>, whose in-depth video dissects the photo comparison, the merch item, and the broader implications for bands operating at Sleep Token\u2019s level. The video doesn\u2019t sensationalize the issue \u2014 it methodically walks through how visual assets are tracked, reused, and often mismanaged once bands scale into arena-level operations. If you want the clearest visual context for how close the alleged usage appears, this breakdown is essential viewing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"The Latest Sleep Token Situation Is WILD\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/L1fMD1AhHzw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Context matters here. Sleep Token operate behind layers of anonymity, with branding and visuals handled through management teams, labels, and merch partners rather than directly by the band members themselves. That doesn\u2019t absolve responsibility \u2014 but it does expose how easily creator rights can get trampled once assets pass through enough hands. This is exactly why licensing agreements exist, and why bands with massive merch operations must treat photographers as collaborators, not disposable resources.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For fans, this raises uncomfortable questions. Purchasing official Sleep Token merchandise \u2014 whether ritual coins, apparel, or tour exclusives \u2014 supports the band\u2019s ecosystem. But when that ecosystem is accused of sidelining the very artists who help build the visual mythology fans buy into, loyalty becomes complicated. Transparency isn\u2019t just good ethics; it\u2019s good brand survival.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn\u2019t an isolated issue within metal. As bands rely more heavily on merch revenue than album sales, visual art has become currency. Photos, logos, stage shots, and fan-created imagery now fuel entire product lines. Without strict ethical standards, exploitation becomes inevitable. Metal has always prided itself on community \u2014 this moment tests whether that value still holds when money enters the equation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Metal Mantra will continue tracking this story as it develops. Whether Sleep Token\u2019s camp responds publicly, resolves the dispute privately, or lets the noise fade remains to be seen. But one thing is clear: the metal world is watching closely, and artists behind the lens are paying attention like never before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more deep dives into metal culture, artist rights, and industry accountability, explore our <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com\">Metal Mantra news hub</a>, check out our <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/category/features\">features section</a>, or support the artists you love responsibly by shopping <a href=\"https://amzn.to/496O1cy\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://amzn.to/496O1cy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">official merch</a> through verified channels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tickets:</strong> <a href=\"https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3DSleep%20Token%20Unlicensed%20Photo%20Merch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Get Sleep Token Unlicensed Photo Merch tickets on Ticketmaster</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More from Metal Mantra:</strong> <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-metal-tracks-of-2025/\">Top 10 Metal Tracks of 2025</a></p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Deftones, Megadeth, Behemoth, Powerwolf, War On Women, and Lionheart all made decisive moves this week, reinforcing how heavy music continues to evolve, resist, and push forward at every level of the scene. Catch more in the <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/\">latest Rundown</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Deftones</strong> closing out the year with a new visual statement feels intentional. The band\u2019s freshly released music video for \u201c<a href=\"https://youtu.be/oTCw6qtzgOg?si=XGIhuEOKErEeTwwZ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Infinite Source</a>\u201d isn\u2019t flashy or overproduced \u2014 it\u2019s atmospheric, controlled, and unmistakably Deftones. The video leans into texture and tension rather than spectacle, reinforcing why the band remains one of the few alternative metal acts still capable of releasing material that feels current without chasing trends. If you\u2019ve been paying attention, this is Deftones doing what they do best: trusting restraint over noise while still hitting hard.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/megadeth\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/megadeth\">Megadeth</a></strong>, on the other hand, aren\u2019t interested in subtlety right now. \u201cLet There Be Shred\u201d arrives loud, unapologetic, and technically aggressive \u2014 a clear reminder that Dave Mustaine has zero intention of softening the band\u2019s legacy as they approach what\u2019s being framed as their final album era. At this point, Megadeth\u2019s mission seems less about reinvention and more about reaffirmation. Precision, speed, and venom still drive the engine, and longtime fans will recognize the message immediately.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s be real \u2014 the underground never waits for permission. <strong>War On Women</strong> announcing a spring 2026 U.S. tour with <strong>Oceanator</strong> is exactly the kind of forward-motion hardcore needs right now. This isn\u2019t nostalgia touring or safe booking. It\u2019s politically charged, confrontational music being put directly in front of audiences that still want their heavy music to mean something beyond riffs.</p>\n<p><strong>Lionheart</strong> keeping things raw with the \u201cSalt The Earth\u201d visualizer fits the band\u2019s DNA perfectly. No overproduction, no forced storytelling \u2014 just blunt-force hardcore energy delivered with clarity. In an era where visuals are often used to distract from weak material, Lionheart flipping that script and letting the song stand front and center feels deliberate.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not exactly shocking, but <strong>Behemoth\u2019s</strong> Nergal defending the album title <em>The Shit Ov God</em> only reinforces why the band remains polarizing by design. This isn\u2019t provocation for clicks \u2014 it\u2019s philosophical hostility aimed straight at institutional comfort. Extreme metal has always existed to unsettle, and Behemoth refusing to sanitize their intent reminds everyone why the genre still has teeth.</p>\n<p><strong>Powerwolf</strong> closing the loop on this cycle with the live single and video \u201cAlive or Undead\u201d feels like a victory lap done right. Pulled from the upcoming <em>Wildlive (Live at Olympiahalle)</em>, the performance captures Powerwolf exactly as fans expect \u2014 theatrical, massive, and dialed to eleven. Live albums only work when bands can actually command a room, and Powerwolf clearly still do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More from Metal Mantra:</strong> <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/\">Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/sick-new-world/\">Sick New World 2026</a></p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Scottish Metal Band Faces Naming Clash With Simon\u202fCowell\u2019s New Pop Project More metal news: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/news/\">News hub</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>December\u202fTenth</em>\u2014the underground Scottish metal outfit that\u2019s earned its reputation one heavy riff at a time\u2014has been thrust into an unexpected legal tangle that\u2019s threatening to drown out its hard\u2011earned online presence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The conflict began when Simon\u202fCowell\u2019s latest pop venture, <em>December\u202f10</em>, dropped its debut. The name\u2019s similarity to the band\u2019s own has already begun to skew search engine results, streaming playlists, and social\u2011media feeds, giving the high\u2011profile pop act an unintended advantage over the seasoned metalers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s not a case of genre confusion. Fans can\u2019t mistake a Scottish metal band for a glossy, reality\u2011TV\u2011backed pop release. The issue is far more brutal: algorithms prioritize volume and capital over the legacy of an underground act. When two entities share a name, the one with the deepest pockets and the biggest marketing machine will dominate the digital space\u2014leaving the smaller band fighting for every click.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a band that has built its following through relentless touring, gritty releases, and a loyal community, a name isn\u2019t just a label\u2014it\u2019s the anchor for flyers, merch, release pages, and every touchpoint that connects them to their audience. When that anchor shifts, everything built around it feels the tug.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The scene has seen similar clashes before, and the pattern is always the same. Independent artists scramble to correct misdirected streams and search results, while the larger entity drives forward with minimal friction. The imbalance is stark: most small acts lack the legal resources to preemptively secure their brand, and by the time a dispute surfaces, the damage is already done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>December\u202fTenth has been a fixture in the metal underground for years, carving out a distinct identity through self\u2011released material, relentless touring, and unwavering scene loyalty. The sudden emergence of Cowell\u2019s <em>December\u202f10</em> threatens to blur that identity across streaming platforms, search engines, and social feeds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The metal community has taken notice, and while the pop project hasn\u2019t officially addressed the confusion, the stakes are clear: either the band\u2019s name remains meaningful to its fanbase, or it gets lost in the noise of a pop brand that can afford to dominate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether the dispute resolves quietly or escalates, this episode underscores a painful reality. The music industry, which often touts creativity, can easily bulldoze smaller voices. For underground metal, the battle isn\u2019t just about grabbing attention\u2014it\u2019s about staying visible, staying alive.</p>\n\n\n<p>More Metal Mantra: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/\">Rundowns</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tours/\">Metal Tours</a></p>\n",

    "content": "<p><a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/janes-addiction/\">Jane\u2019s Addiction</a> are officially finished \u2014 and this time, it\u2019s not another pause, hiatus, or \u201cwe\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d The band has confirmed they are no longer together, bringing a definitive end to one of alternative rock\u2019s most influential, chaotic, and unpredictable careers after months of internal tension and escalating legal issues. More metal news: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/news/\">News hub</a>.</p>\n<p>For a group that spent decades existing in a near-constant state of volatility, this breakup hits differently. There\u2019s no farewell tour being teased. No final album rollout. No vague statements about \u201ctime apart.\u201d According to sources close to the situation, the split comes down to a complete breakdown in trust, with legal disputes pushing things past the point of repair \u2014 even by Jane\u2019s Addiction standards.</p>\n<p>Formed in Los Angeles in the mid-1980s, Jane\u2019s Addiction emerged at a moment when underground rock was fragmenting into new shapes. Led by <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/perry-farrell/\">Perry Farrell</a> alongside guitarist <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/dave-navarro/\">Dave Navarro</a>, bassist <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/eric-avery/\">Eric Avery</a>, and drummer <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/stephen-perkins/\">Stephen Perkins</a>, the band carved out a sound that didn\u2019t sit cleanly in punk, metal, or art rock \u2014 and didn\u2019t care to. Albums like <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4anW0Es\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Nothing\u2019s Shocking</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3YxxMjN\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Ritual de lo Habitual</a></em> didn\u2019t just define an era; they helped set the table for the alternative explosion of the 1990s.</p>\n<p>That influence is impossible to overstate. Jane\u2019s Addiction were never about polish or predictability. They thrived on friction \u2014 musically, personally, and visually. Their confrontational performances, psychedelic textures, and refusal to fit into neat genre boxes made them a blueprint for countless bands that followed, especially those operating in the space between alternative rock and metal.</p>\n<p>But if you\u2019ve followed their history at all, this outcome isn\u2019t exactly shocking.</p>\n<p>Jane\u2019s Addiction were never built for stability. Their story is littered with breakups, reunions, and half-resurrections, often driven by the same creative tension that made the band compelling in the first place. What makes this split different is the finality. Legal fallout and internal disputes have reportedly made reconciliation impossible, eliminating even the possibility of limited live appearances under the band\u2019s name.</p>\n<p>And that\u2019s the real line in the sand.</p>\n<p>There are no plans for a goodbye run. No \u201cone last show.\u201d No symbolic closing chapter onstage. In an era where legacy acts are endlessly recycled through reunion tours and anniversary cycles, Jane\u2019s Addiction choosing to stop outright feels almost radical.</p>\n<p>Their cultural footprint extends far beyond albums and tours. Farrell\u2019s creation of <a href=\"https://www.lollapalooza.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lollapalooza</a> \u2014 which began as the band\u2019s original 1991 farewell tour \u2014 reshaped the live music landscape, bridging underground scenes with mainstream audiences and permanently changing how alternative music was presented on a global scale. That alone secures Jane\u2019s Addiction a permanent place in music history.</p>\n<p>The band\u2019s dissolution also carries weight beyond nostalgia. Jane\u2019s Addiction existed at the crossroads of genres, influencing alternative rock, industrial, and metal artists alike. Their embrace of chaos, sexuality, and artistic risk helped normalize a kind of creative freedom that feels increasingly rare in a music industry driven by algorithms and safe returns.</p>\n<p>For fans, the news is bittersweet but unsurprising. Jane\u2019s Addiction had been operating on borrowed time for years, and recent developments only accelerated what many already suspected was inevitable. Still, the catalog remains \u2014 and continues to find new life through streaming platforms, vinyl reissues, and younger listeners discovering the band for the first time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com\">Metal Mantra</a> has long explored how internal conflict can shape a band\u2019s mythology as much as its music. Jane\u2019s Addiction now joins that lineage fully realized \u2014 influential, turbulent, and uncompromising to the very end.</p>\n<p>In a landscape obsessed with endless comebacks, walking away instead of diluting the legacy may be the most Jane\u2019s Addiction move possible.</p>\n",

    "title": "Thrash of the Titans USA Tour 2026: Testament, Overkill & Destruction Unite for an Epic Thrash Metal Assault",
    "content": "<p>The thrash metal gods have smiled upon us \u2013 <strong>Thrash of the Titans</strong> is back and it\u2019s coming to the United States in spring 2026. Bay Area legends <strong>Testament</strong> are teaming up with New Jersey\u2019s own <strong>Overkill</strong> and German thrash pioneers <strong>Destruction</strong> for a nationwide tour that promises to bring total metallic chaos to every city it hits. This tour is more than just a concert series; it\u2019s a celebration of the energy and legacy of thrash metal, uniting three veteran bands whose combined influence spans nearly four decades. Tickets and tour roundups live on our <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tours/\">Tours &amp; Tickets hub</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even the official tour poster screams pure \u201980s thrash attitude, featuring a sinister skull-faced mascot and bold, electrifying artwork. Dubbed the <em>\u201cThrash of the Titans\u201d</em> U.S. Tour, this run will tear through major markets from the West Coast to the East. Fans can expect an all-out assault of whiplash-inducing riffs, breakneck drums, and mosh pits that feel like time-travel back to the genre\u2019s golden era. Each band on the bill is a bona fide titan: Testament just dropped their crushing new album <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3YwIwPn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\"><em>Para Bellum</em></a> in October to roaring acclaim, Overkill continue to uphold East Coast thrash with unapologetic ferocity, and Destruction fly the flag for Teutonic thrash as fiercely as ever. In short, this tour is a dream come true for thrash metal fans hungry for a no-holds-barred live experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Thrash Metal Legends Unite \u2013 An Unmissable Event</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to thrash pedigree, this lineup is second to none. Between them, Testament, Overkill, and Destruction have nearly 40 years of friendship and shared history on the frontlines of metal. Testament helped define the late-\u201980s Bay Area thrash sound and remain \u201cone of the greatest thrash metal acts of all time\u201d, while Overkill\u2019s status as perpetual road warriors (with a whopping 20 studio albums to their name) earns them the title of thrash\u2019s East Coast ironmen. Not to be outdone, Destruction are among the earliest German thrash outfits, inspiring countless others since the early \u201980s. It\u2019s no wonder Testament frontman Chuck Billy is stoked for this tour\u2019s incendiary potential. In his words:</p>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201c2026 looks like it is going to start with an explosion with the \u2018Thrash of the Titans\u2019 Tour. Joining us will be our Metal Brothers Overkill and Destruction. Our friendship has almost reached 4 decades. This is gonna be a Thrash Metal show you don\u2019t wanna miss!\u201d</p>\n<p><cite>\u2013 Chuck Billy, Testament vocalist</cite></p></blockquote>\n\n\n<p>Testament\u2019s ferocious live performances and powerhouse vocals have only grown more intense with time (Loudwire even honored <em>Para Bellum</em> as the best metal album of 2025). Overkill\u2019s Bobby \u201cBlitz\u201d Ellsworth, never one to hold back, adds that \u201cMarch can\u2019t come soon enough\u201d for this \u201ckiller package that will lay waste to the States\u201d \u2013 a sentiment every die-hard thrasher can agree with. Destruction, led by the indomitable Schmier, are fresh off a successful European leg of <em>Thrash of the Titans</em> and are poised to deliver their razor-sharp riffs and high-octane stage show to U.S. audiences. In other words, expect headbangers\u2019 heaven. The energy in the venues each night will be off the charts as these three veteran acts ignite the stage with classic anthems and new thrash artillery alike. (Pro tip: start warming up those neck muscles now for all the headbanging in your near future!)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Exclusive Presales &amp; Ticket On-Sale Info</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For those ready to secure their spot in the pit, several ticket presales will give the most devoted fans first crack at tickets.

    "title": "Rock for People 2026 Names Halsey as Final Headliner for Festival: Locks in Top 10 Status in Europe",
    "content": "\n<p><strong><a href=\"/tag/rock-for-people/\">Rock for People 2026</a></strong> has officially named its final headliner for next summer, and it\u2019s not playing it safe. Halsey will headline the Czech festival for the first time ever, locking in her debut performance in the country and completing the top line of what\u2019s shaping up to be one of the most aggressive, genre-defying European festival lineups of the year. We&#8217;ll keep updates rolling in our <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/rock-for-people-2026/\">Rock for People 2026 coverage</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Tickets:</strong> <a href=\"https://rockforpeople.cz/en/tickets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Buy Rock for People 2026 passes now</a> (VIP/COMFY+ are moving fast).</p>\n\n\n<p>The announcement arrived December 15 via the festival\u2019s annual Advent calendar reveal, confirming Halsey\u2019s headline set for <strong>June 13, 2026</strong> at Park 360 in Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9. She joins a heavyweight Rock for People 2026 bill already stacked with Gorillaz, Limp Bizkit, <a href=\"/tag/bring-me-the-horizon/\">Bring Me The Horizon</a>, and Iron Maiden \u2014 a lineup that doesn\u2019t just span generations, but actively challenges expectations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s be clear: this isn\u2019t a \u201csafe\u201d booking. And that\u2019s the point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Halsey doesn\u2019t play by genre rules, and never has. She\u2019s headlined Reading &amp; Leeds. She\u2019s dominated Sziget. She\u2019s collaborated with Bring Me The Horizon on a full-blown metalcore track and traded pop-punk chaos with Machine Gun Kelly on \u201cforget me too.\u201d If you still think she\u2019s just a pop act, you haven\u2019t been paying attention \u2014 or you\u2019re choosing not to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Festival founder Michal Thomes called it exactly what it is: closing the headliner announcements with a modern, world-class artist who actually makes sense in 2026. Love her or hate her, Halsey commands crowds, headlines massive festivals, and brings a fanbase that shows up loud. That matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her timing couldn\u2019t be better either. This year marks <strong>10 years of \u201cBadlands\u201d</strong> \u2014 an album that refuses to die and keeps going viral for all the right reasons. \u201cColors.\u201d \u201cGasoline.\u201d \u201cControl.\u201d Still hitting. Still resonating. Over <strong>5.8 million albums sold</strong>, <strong>7.5 billion streams</strong>, and every single track eligible for RIAA certification \u2014 something that\u2019s only happened twice before in history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s not hype. That\u2019s impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast forward to now and Halsey sits on over <strong>50 billion global streams</strong>, four RIAA-certified albums, and the rare distinction of having <strong>four separate songs hit one billion streams on Spotify</strong>. Her most recent release, <em>The Great Impersonator</em> (October 2024), leaned hard into identity, reinvention, and darker emotional textures \u2014 a move that lands far closer to alternative culture than mainstream fluff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Rock for People keeps leveling up. The festival has officially been named among the <strong>TOP 10 best festivals in Europe</strong> at the European Festival Awards, earning nominations for Best Major Festival, Promoter of the Year, and Event Safety. That\u2019s not marketing spin \u2014 that\u2019s international recognition, alongside heavyweights like Hellfest, Primavera Sound, Rock Werchter, Roskilde, Tomorrowland, and Sziget.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tickets are already moving fast. Organizers confirmed that <strong>VIP and COMFY+ passes are close to selling out</strong>, with overall demand tracking higher than last year\u2019s record-breaking edition. If you\u2019re on the fence, that\u2019s on you. Tickets are available here: <a href=\"https://rockforpeople.cz/en/tickets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rock for People 2026 tickets</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Advent calendar rollout isn\u2019t done yet either. Fifteen of twenty-four new names have been revealed so far, including Wolf Alice, A Day To Remember, Trivium, Queensr\u00ffche, letlive., Within Temptation, Badflower, and more. Nine more bands are still coming, and if the pacing tells us anything, the curveballs aren\u2019t finished.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rock for People 2026 is shaping up to be a genre-collision in the best way possible \u2014 metal, hardcore, alternative, pop-adjacent chaos, and legacy acts all sharing the same battlefield. Some purists will complain. They always do. Everyone else will be too busy watching one of Europe\u2019s best festivals continue to outgrow expectations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If this feels familiar, it should. Two years ago, Rock for People caught heat for booking Yungblud \u2014 plenty of noise, plenty of doubt. Then he walked onstage, leveled the place, and walked off as one of the weekend\u2019s biggest wins. Booking Halsey next to <a href=\"/tag/iron-maiden/\">Iron Maiden</a> and BMTH isn\u2019t a gamble. It\u2019s pattern recognition.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Iron Maiden\u2019s Presence Changes the Entire Lineup</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Iron Maiden sitting atop the Rock for People 2026 lineup isn\u2019t just another legacy booking \u2014 it fundamentally reshapes how the entire bill is perceived. When a band with this level of history headlines, everything around them gets reframed. New artists feel riskier. Genre lines blur faster. Expectations rise across the board.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s the weight of <strong>Iron Maiden\u2019s legacy</strong>. Decades of albums, tours, and cultural influence have made them more than just festival headliners \u2014 they\u2019re a measuring stick. Sharing a bill with Maiden isn\u2019t about nostalgia; it\u2019s about standing next to one of the most complete and influential discographies heavy music has ever produced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For fans who want deeper context on why Iron Maiden can anchor a lineup this diverse in 2026, our full breakdown of <a href=\"/iron-maiden-discography-legacy/\" rel=\"internal\"><strong>Iron Maiden\u2019s discography and legacy</strong></a> explores how the band\u2019s catalog evolved, why it still commands global festival stages, and how it continues to influence the modern acts standing beside them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes evolution is loud. Sometimes it\u2019s uncomfortable. And sometimes it sells out anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rock for People 2026 takes place June 10\u201314 at Park 360, Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9.</strong></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Buy Rock for People 2026 passes now</strong> before this tier closes: <a href=\"https://rockforpeople.cz/en/tickets/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rockforpeople.cz/en/tickets</a></p>\n\n\n<p>Related: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/rock-for-people-2026-iron-maiden-knocked-loose/\">Rock for People Adds Knocked Loose, Saxon, Alexisonfire to Iron Maiden Day</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/gorillaz-limp-bizkit-announced-for-rock-for-people-2026/\">Gorillaz &#038; Limp Bizkit Announced for Rock for People 2026</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>More Metal Mantra: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tours/\">Metal Tours &amp; Tickets Hub</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/\">Rundowns</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tickets:</strong> <a href=\"https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3DRock%20for%20People\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Get Rock for People tickets on Ticketmaster</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More from Metal Mantra:</strong> <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/\">Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/iron-maiden-discography-legacy/\">Iron Maiden Discography &#038; Legacy</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/aftershock-2025-review/\">Aftershock 2025</a></p>\n",

    "title": "Evanescence Bring Jacoby Shaddix Onstage for \u201cBring Me to Life\u201d at KROQ Almost Acoustic Christmas",
    "content": "<p>Evanescence Bring Me to Life live became one of the most talked-about moments at KROQ Almost Acoustic Christmas when the band brought Papa Roach\u2019s Jacoby Shaddix onstage for a surprise performance of \u201cBring Me to Life\u201d during their set. The unexpected collaboration instantly electrified the venue and sent waves through the metal and hard rock community, reigniting excitement around one of the most defining crossover songs of the early 2000s. More metal news: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/news/\">News hub</a>.</p>\n<p>Originally released in 2003 as part of Evanescence\u2019s breakthrough album <em>Fallen</em>, \u201cBring Me to Life\u201d helped introduce a generation of listeners to a darker, more emotional form of mainstream heavy music. While the studio version famously featured male guest vocals, live performances of the song have evolved significantly over the years. Evanescence has often reshaped the track to reflect the band\u2019s growth, making guest appearances rare and deliberate. Bringing Jacoby Shaddix into the performance felt less like a nostalgic callback and more like a deliberate reimagining that honored the song\u2019s legacy while injecting it with renewed intensity.</p>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed alignwide is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Evanescence \u2013 Bring Me to Life Live feat Jacoby Shaddix | Los Angeles, CA \u2013 2025\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/q88m6hrs1JQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n</figure>\n<p>The chemistry between <strong>Amy Lee</strong> and Shaddix was immediate. Lee\u2019s controlled, soaring vocal delivery contrasted sharply with Shaddix\u2019s aggressive, rhythmic approach, creating a push-and-pull dynamic that reminded audiences why \u201cBring Me to Life\u201d resonated so deeply when it first arrived. The crowd\u2019s reaction was instantaneous, with the entire venue erupting as Shaddix took over the song\u2019s iconic verses and trade-offs with Lee.</p>\n<p>This moment also highlighted Evanescence\u2019s continued relevance within modern heavy music. Rather than relying solely on legacy status, the band continues to reinterpret its catalog in ways that feel current and authentic. As previously covered on <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/evanescence/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/evanescence/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Metal Mantra</a>, Evanescence has consistently found ways to balance reverence for their past with a forward-looking approach that keeps their live performances compelling.</p>\n<p>For Jacoby Shaddix, the guest appearance reinforced his ongoing presence within the metal and hard rock scene. Papa Roach remains a dominant live force, and Shaddix\u2019s adaptability as a vocalist allows him to move seamlessly between melody and raw aggression. His contribution to \u201cBring Me to Life\u201d felt natural rather than forced, underscoring the shared musical lineage between the two bands that emerged during the same era of heavy alternative music.</p>\n<p>KROQ Almost Acoustic Christmas has long been known for producing memorable collaborative moments, and this performance fit squarely within that tradition. The festival\u2019s blend of alternative rock, hard rock, and metal creates an environment where surprises feel organic rather than scripted. Evanescence\u2019s decision to bring Shaddix onstage elevated their set beyond a standard festival appearance, turning it into a defining moment of the event.</p>\n<p>As fan-filmed clips of the performance continue circulating online, reactions have centered on the emotional impact and chemistry between Lee and Shaddix. For many fans, the collaboration bridged eras, reconnecting listeners with the music that first drew them into heavy rock while presenting it in a modern, revitalized form.</p>\n<p>For listeners revisiting Evanescence\u2019s catalog, <em>Fallen</em> remains essential listening. The album continues to be widely available through platforms like <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00019GG1M?&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=metalmantra-20&amp;linkId=9c7534e4e29f95f5fe025936235391f9&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00019GG1M?&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=metalmantra-20&amp;linkId=9c7534e4e29f95f5fe025936235391f9&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Amazon</a>, where both physical and digital editions remain popular with longtime fans and new listeners alike.</p>\n<p>In an era dominated by rapid-release cycles and algorithm-driven discovery, moments like this stand out because they can\u2019t be manufactured. Evanescence and Jacoby Shaddix didn\u2019t just perform a song \u2014 they reaffirmed its place in the ongoing story of modern metal and hard rock, reminding fans why live music remains one of the most powerful experiences the genre has to offer.</p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Iron Maiden\u2019s 2026 tour continues to grow as the legendary band expands their <em>Run For Your Lives</em> World Tour with a massive new leg of dates. What began as a celebratory victory lap has evolved into one of the most ambitious and far-reaching touring cycles of Iron Maiden\u2019s career, blending festival headline slots, stadium performances, and major arena shows across multiple continents. Tickets and tour roundups live on our <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tours/\">Tours &amp; Tickets hub</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The continued expansion of the <em>Run For Your Lives world tour</em> reinforces Iron Maiden\u2019s status as one of the most dominant live metal acts in the world, even five decades into their career. Rather than limiting the anniversary celebration to a single year, the band has structured this tour as a rolling global event, responding directly to sustained demand from fans worldwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A 50-Year Legacy Meets a Global Touring Juggernaut</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First announced in September 2024, the <em>Iron Maiden anniversary tour</em> was designed to celebrate the band\u2019s formation in 1975 while highlighting the legacy-defining era of their catalog. Instead of following a traditional album-cycle format, the band opted for a long-term touring strategy that allows new dates to be added as markets open and demand continues to surge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tour officially launched in May 2025 in Budapest, Hungary, quickly selling out stadiums and festival appearances across Europe. With the newly announced 2026 expansion, Iron Maiden will continue touring deep into the fall, with the current schedule projected to conclude in October 2026 \u2014 marking nearly two full years of global heavy metal domination.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Iron Maiden 2026 Tour Dates \u2014 Europe, North America &amp; Beyond</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Below are the currently confirmed <strong>Iron Maiden tour dates for 2026</strong> as part of the <em>Run For Your Lives</em> world tour.

The approach emphasizes legacy-defining tracks while reintroducing deep cuts that longtime fans may not have heard live in decades.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> For collectors and longtime fans, essential Iron Maiden albums on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=iron+maiden+vinyl&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=metalmantra-20&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">vinyl and CD</a> remain widely available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This balance between accessibility and deep-catalog respect has become a defining feature of Iron Maiden\u2019s modern touring era. For a deeper look at how this tour fits into their career arc, explore our <a href=\"/metal-mantra/iron-maiden-discography-legacy-ranking\" rel=\"internal\">Iron Maiden discography &amp; legacy ranking</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Iron Maiden\u2019s Legacy Still Shapes Modern Metal</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What makes the <em>Run For Your Lives</em> tour hit harder than a standard anniversary run is how directly it taps into <strong>Iron Maiden\u2019s legacy</strong> \u2014 not as a nostalgia act, but as a living blueprint for heavy metal. From the twin-guitar attack to the theatrical stage production and marathon setlists, this tour pulls from decades of influence that still echo through modern metal and hard rock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The setlist choices alone underline how deep the band\u2019s catalog runs. Tracks pulled from Maiden\u2019s classic era don\u2019t just exist as crowd-pleasers \u2014 they represent the foundation of an <strong>Iron Maiden discography</strong> that helped define what metal could be on a global scale. Very few bands can tour stadiums in 2026 while leaning this heavily on material written before most of the audience was born.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For fans looking to understand how this tour connects to the bigger picture, our in-depth breakdown of <a href=\"/iron-maiden-discography-legacy/\" rel=\"internal\"><strong>Iron Maiden\u2019s discography and legacy</strong></a> explores the albums, eras, and turning points that made a tour of this scale possible \u2014 and why Maiden\u2019s influence still feels unavoidable nearly 50 years on.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why This Tour Matters</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <em>Run For Your Lives</em> world tour stands as a rare example of a legacy metal act continuing to evolve rather than simply revisit the past. Notably, the tour also marks Iron Maiden\u2019s first full run without longtime drummer Nicko McBrain, following his retirement from touring in late 2024, with Simon Dawson stepping in on drums.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Iron Maiden live performances continue to draw massive crowds across continents, the 2026 expansion further cements the band\u2019s status as one of heavy metal\u2019s most enduring and influential forces.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Update Note:</strong> This article will be updated as additional Iron Maiden 2026 tour dates are announced.

    "title": "Static-X Estate Pushes Back Against Unauthorized Wayne Static Documentary",
    "content": "<p>The legacy of <strong>Wayne Static</strong> has once again become the focus of debate within the industrial metal world, following a public response from the Static-X family and estate regarding an upcoming documentary that has not received their authorization. As interest in Wayne Static\u2019s life and influence continues to grow, the situation has sparked important questions about artistic intent, ownership, and how the stories of metal\u2019s most influential figures should be preserved. More metal news: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/news/\">News hub</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to representatives of the Wayne Static estate, the documentary in question is moving forward without approval from Wayne\u2019s family or the family of his late wife, <strong>Tera Wray</strong>. In a strongly worded statement, the families expressed serious concerns about the project\u2019s focus on deeply personal periods of their lives, emphasizing that these chapters represent painful experiences rather than entertainment or historical curiosity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wayne Static\u2019s death in 2014 marked a devastating loss for the metal community, followed by the tragic passing of Tera Wray in 2016. For those closest to them, these events remain intensely private. The families argue that revisiting these struggles without consent risks reducing complex, human experiences into spectacle, particularly when Wayne\u2019s music and artistic output already address many of the darker realities he faced.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">An Official Static-X Documentary Is Already Underway, Says Estate</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding context to the dispute is the existence of an official, estate-approved documentary titled <em>Evil Disco \u2013 The Rise, Fall, And Regeneration of Static-X</em>, which is currently in post-production. This sanctioned film is intended to provide a comprehensive and respectful examination of Wayne Static\u2019s life, the formation of Static-X, their rise during the late 1990s industrial metal boom, and the band\u2019s evolution in the years following Wayne\u2019s passing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The estate has indicated that this project represents the definitive account they wish fans to see, combining archival material with firsthand perspectives from those who knew Wayne best. It is expected to explore not only the band\u2019s success, but also the internal conflicts, personal struggles, and creative vision that defined Wayne Static\u2019s career. More details about the official documentary have previously been discussed in coverage on <a href=\"/metal-news/official-static-x-documentary\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Metal Mantra</a>, as anticipation continues to build for its eventual release.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Filmmaker Defends Separate Documentary Vision</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The filmmaker behind the unauthorized project has <a href=\"https://blabbermouth.net/news/director-of-upcoming-unauthorized-wayne-static-documentary-responds-to-estates-strenuous-objection\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://blabbermouth.net/news/director-of-upcoming-unauthorized-wayne-static-documentary-responds-to-estates-strenuous-objection\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">publicly defended</a> his work, stating that his intention is to focus specifically on Wayne Static and Tera Wray as individuals rather than on Static-X as a band. He has described the film as a personal account shaped by his relationship with the couple, arguing that it offers a different perspective than the official documentary currently being developed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While acknowledging the objections raised by the estate, the filmmaker maintains that both projects could exist independently, each addressing different aspects of Wayne Static\u2019s story. However, the estate has firmly rejected this position, reiterating that any use of unreleased material, likenesses, or voice recordings connected to Wayne Static requires explicit authorization. This stance reflects a broader effort to protect Wayne\u2019s artistic legacy from misrepresentation or unauthorized exploitation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Wayne Static\u2019s Enduring Influence on Industrial Metal</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Wayne Static remains one of the most distinctive figures in industrial metal history. With the release of <em>Wisconsin Death Trip</em> in 1999, Static-X helped redefine the genre by blending mechanical grooves, electronic textures, and aggressive metal riffing into what Wayne famously described as \u201cevil disco.\u201d Tracks like \u201cPush It\u201d and \u201cBled for Days\u201d became genre touchstones, while Wayne\u2019s unmistakable vocal delivery and striking visual presence cemented his status as an icon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the band\u2019s commercial success, Static-X faced internal tensions and creative challenges that eventually led to their split in the early 2010s. Wayne\u2019s struggles during this period were well documented through his music and interviews, offering fans an unfiltered glimpse into the pressures of life within the metal industry. His influence, however, did not fade with his passing; instead, it has continued to shape discussions around industrial metal\u2019s evolution.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Static-X\u2019s Modern Era and Ongoing Legacy</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Static-X\u2019s reformation in 2018 introduced a new chapter in the band\u2019s history, one focused on honoring Wayne Static while allowing the remaining members to continue performing. Through extensive touring and the release of the <em>Project Regeneration</em> albums, the band incorporated previously recorded vocal material from Wayne, giving fans the opportunity to hear his voice on new music years after his death.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The success of these releases and tours demonstrated that Wayne Static\u2019s influence remains deeply embedded in the band\u2019s identity. Discussions about future music have suggested that Static-X may eventually move forward with entirely new material, but only after completing the official documentary. This measured approach reflects the care being taken to balance artistic progression with respect for Wayne\u2019s legacy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Legacy Worth Protecting</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The ongoing dispute surrounding the unauthorized documentary underscores a broader issue faced by many artists\u2019 estates: determining how stories are told after death, and who has the right to tell them. For the Static-X family, protecting Wayne Static\u2019s legacy means ensuring his life and work are presented with honesty, dignity, and proper context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As interest in Wayne Static and Static-X continues to grow, fans remain invested not only in the music, but in the integrity of the stories surrounding it. Whether through official documentaries, live performances, or future releases, Wayne Static\u2019s presence continues to resonate across industrial metal, reminding the scene why his impact endures decades after his rise.</p>\n\n\n<p>Related: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/official-static-x-documentary/\">An Official Static-X Documentary Is Already Underway, Says Estate</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>More Metal Mantra: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/\">Rundowns</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tours/\">Metal Tours</a></p>\n",

    "content": "<p><strong>The top 10 metal tracks of 2025</strong> tell the story of a year where heavy music hit harder emotionally as it did sonically. Riffs still crushed, but vulnerability, ambition, and boundary-pushing creativity defined the conversation just as much. These are the songs that moved crowds, dominated playlists, and proved metal is still evolving rather than standing still. More metal news: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/news/\">News hub</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"/track/pale-moonlight-dayseeker\">1. Pale Moonlight \u2014 Dayseeker</a></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dayseeker opened 2025 with cinematic weight on <em>Pale Moonlight</em>, a track that immediately felt bigger than a standard single. As the first release from <em>Creature in the Black Night</em>, it blended shimmering melodies with emotional tension, pulling listeners into a dark, atmospheric space built on restraint rather than excess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lyrically centered on toxic cycles and inner conflict, <em>Pale Moonlight</em> struck a nerve without leaning on melodrama. It wasn\u2019t just an introduction to a new album cycle \u2014 it was a statement that Dayseeker had fully stepped into their role as one of heavy music\u2019s most emotionally resonant bands.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"/track/specter-bad-omens\">2. Specter \u2014 Bad Omens</a></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Specter</em> showcased Bad Omens at their most refined and deliberate. Built on layered production, pulsing rhythms, and a brooding sense of atmosphere, the track blurred the line between heavy music and modern alternative without losing its edge. Every element felt intentional, from the pacing to the way tension builds across the song.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than chasing volume for impact, <em>Specter</em> relied on mood and dynamics, reinforcing Bad Omens\u2019 evolution into a band comfortable pushing past traditional genre boundaries while still delivering weight where it matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"/track/dying-to-love-bad-omens\">3. Dying to Love \u2014 Bad Omens</a></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Following <em>Specter</em>, <em>Dying to Love</em> leaned further into emotional complexity. The track balanced soaring melodies with controlled aggression, creating a push-and-pull between vulnerability and force that resonated with both longtime fans and newer listeners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its ability to live comfortably in both introspective listening sessions and high-energy live environments made it one of Bad Omens\u2019 most versatile releases of the year, cementing their strong presence across 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"/track/bloodlust-dayseeker\">4. Bloodlust \u2014 Dayseeker</a></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If <em>Pale Moonlight</em> represented Dayseeker\u2019s reflective side, <em>Bloodlust</em> was pure confrontation. Driven by aggressive rhythms and heavier instrumentation, the track delivered an unfiltered burst of intensity that felt purpose-built for live crowds and cathartic release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Bloodlust</em> showed that Dayseeker\u2019s emotional range isn\u2019t limited to atmosphere alone \u2014 when they lean into aggression, they do so with focus and intent, never sacrificing clarity for chaos.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"/track/emergence-sleep-token\">5. Emergence \u2014 Sleep Token</a></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Emergence</em> became one of the defining moments of 2025 almost immediately. Released March 13, Sleep Token\u2019s single broke into mainstream consciousness while still retaining its experimental core, landing on major charts without sanding down its edges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The track\u2019s blend of delicate piano passages, crushing heaviness, and unexpected stylistic shifts made it impossible to pin down. <em>Emergence</em> didn\u2019t just succeed commercially \u2014 it challenged expectations of what a modern heavy song could be, expanding the genre\u2019s reach without diluting its identity.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"/track/no-loss-no-love-spiritbox\">6. No Loss, No Love \u2014 Spiritbox</a></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Spiritbox entered 2025 with precision and confidence on <em>No Loss, No Love</em>. The song\u2019s abrupt transitions between haunting ambience and explosive heaviness highlighted the band\u2019s comfort with unpredictability, anchored by Courtney LaPlante\u2019s dynamic vocal performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than chasing immediacy, the track rewarded close listening, reinforcing Spiritbox\u2019s reputation as innovators who thrive in tension, contrast, and controlled chaos.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"/track/whiplash-architects\">7. Whiplash \u2014 Architects</a></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Whiplash</em> reaffirmed Architects\u2019 standing as one of modern metal\u2019s most reliable forces. With tightly constructed riffs, driving rhythms, and an unmistakable sense of urgency, the track proved the band\u2019s ability to evolve without abandoning their foundation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It landed hard in live settings and heavy rotations alike, serving as a reminder that experience doesn\u2019t soften impact \u2014 it sharpens it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"/track/end-of-you-poppy-amy-lee-courtney-laplante\">8. End of You \u2014 Poppy, Amy Lee &amp; Courtney LaPlante</a></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the year\u2019s most talked-about collaborations, <em>End of You</em> brought together three distinct voices from different corners of heavy music. Poppy, Amy Lee, and Courtney LaPlante combined forces on a track that felt cinematic, dramatic, and unapologetically powerful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than clashing, each artist\u2019s identity elevated the others. The result was a song that felt massive without feeling forced \u2014 a rare example of crossover collaboration done right.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"/track/violent-nature-i-prevail\">9. Violent Nature \u2014 I Prevail</a></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Violent Nature</em> leaned into everything I Prevail do best: massive hooks, clean production, and just enough grit to keep things grounded. The song walked the line between accessibility and aggression without tipping too far in either direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its staying power across playlists and live sets made it one of the most consistently played heavy tracks of the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"/track/sacred-parkway-drive\">10. Sacred \u2014 Parkway Drive</a></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Parkway Drive closed out the list with <em>Sacred</em>, a track that felt like a reaffirmation rather than a reinvention. Built on anthemic energy, thick riffs, and undeniable momentum, it reminded listeners why the band remains a dominant live force.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Sacred</em> worked everywhere \u2014 in the pit, on speakers, and through headphones \u2014 the hallmark of a true late-career standout.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Final Thoughts \u2014 Why 2025 Will Be Remembered</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From chart-breaking breakthroughs to emotionally driven heavy anthems, 2025 proved metal isn\u2019t slowing down \u2014 it\u2019s adapting. These ten tracks captured that evolution, balancing power with purpose and aggression with honesty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to hear these songs back-to-back, check out our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch_videos?video_ids=k95oDnsCu_8,EUe9UhcUtEI,4xq5QzNG-m8,O5Io3Kbxzvs,YfKlcLKDkz0,c67cjKK_08M,3rS83uI0Wak,lCM2YxDg6OQ,8v4oxxvs8iY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2025 Picks playlist</a> and stream the tracks that defined the year.</p>\n\n\n<p>More Metal Mantra: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/\">Rundowns</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-metal-tours-coming-in-2026/\">Top 10 Metal Tours in 2026</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Listen/Buy:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Top+10+Metal+Tracks+That+Defined+2025&#038;tag=metalmantra-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Find on Amazon</a></p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Swedish melodic death metal titans <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/amon-amarth/\">Amon Amarth</a> and animated cult phenomenon <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/dethklok/\">Dethklok</a> have officially joined forces for one of the most anticipated metal tours of 2026, unveiling a co-headlining North American run that merges Viking brutality with animated extreme metal spectacle. The tour, appropriately titled <strong>The Amonklok Conquest</strong>, will also feature rising doom metal outfit <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/castle-rat/\">Castle Rat</a> as support, creating a lineup that blends legacy, theatricality, and underground momentum into a single night of heavy metal excess. Tickets and tour roundups live on our <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tours/\">Tours &amp; Tickets hub</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Amonklok Conquest kicks off April 15, 2026 in Phoenix, Arizona at the Arizona Financial Theatre and storms across the continent before concluding May 21, 2026 in Las Vegas at PH Live at Planet Hollywood Resort &amp; Casino. Along the way, the tour will hit major markets including San Antonio, Houston, Oklahoma City, Kansas City, Minneapolis, Brooklyn, Boston, Toronto, Montreal, Atlanta, Nashville, Detroit, Denver, and Salt Lake City, delivering a full-scale production designed to satisfy fans of both crushing metal riffs and immersive stagecraft.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amon Amarth continue to stand as one of modern metal\u2019s most consistent live forces, bringing their battle-ready anthems and Viking-themed visuals to stages worldwide. Known for albums like <em>Twilight of the Thunder God</em> and their more recent release <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4rZ921v\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The Great Heathen Army</a></em>, the band has built a career on combining melodic death metal ferocity with epic storytelling. Their live shows are equal parts concert and cinematic experience, often featuring towering stage props, synchronized lighting, and a relentless setlist built for mass chanting and raised horns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dethklok\u2019s presence on the tour adds a different kind of spectacle altogether. Born from Adult Swim\u2019s <em>Metalocalypse</em>, the fictional band has long since transcended animation, evolving into a legitimate touring act led by creator and multi-instrumentalist Brendon Small. With the recent release of <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3XYuhCL\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Dethalbum IV</a></em>, Dethklok\u2019s live performances now merge high-definition animation, synchronized video elements, and crushing extreme metal into a show that feels both absurd and brutally precise. The Amonklok Conquest represents one of the largest touring platforms Dethklok has ever undertaken, cementing their place as more than a novelty act.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tickets for The Amonklok Conquest go on sale to the general public Friday, December 12 at 10 a.m. local time via <a href=\"https://www.ticketmaster.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Ticketmaster</a>, with artist presales and select venue presales available in advance. VIP packages and exclusive merchandise bundles are also expected to be offered, giving fans early access, limited collectibles, and premium experiences. Fans are encouraged to act quickly, as early demand suggests many dates could sell out rapidly.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>THE AMONKLOK CONQUEST TOUR DATES:</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apr 15: Phoenix, AZ \u2013 Arizona Financial Theatre</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apr 17: San Antonio, TX \u2013 Boeing Center at Tech Port</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apr 18: Houston, TX \u2013 713 Music Hall</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apr 20: Oklahoma City, OK \u2013 The Criterion</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apr 21: Kansas City, MO \u2013 The Midland Theatre</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apr 22: Chesterfield, MO \u2013 The Factory</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apr 24: Minneapolis, MN \u2013 The Armory</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apr 25: Waukee, IA \u2013 Vibrant Music Hall</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apr 28: Brooklyn, NY \u2013 Brooklyn Paramount</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apr 29: Boston, MA \u2013 MGM Music Hall At Fenway</li>\n\n\n\n<li>May 01: Toronto, ON \u2013 Great Canadian Casino Resort</li>\n\n\n\n<li>May 02: Montreal, QC \u2013 Bell Centre</li>\n\n\n\n<li>May 05: National Harbor, MD \u2013 The Theater at MGM National Harbor</li>\n\n\n\n<li>May 09: Atlanta, GA \u2013 Coca-Cola Roxy</li>\n\n\n\n<li>May 10: Nashville, TN \u2013 The Pinnacle</li>\n\n\n\n<li>May 12: Johnstown, PA\u00a0 \u2013 1st Summit Arena</li>\n\n\n\n<li>May 13: Detroit, MI \u2013 Fox Theatre</li>\n\n\n\n<li>May 14: Bethlehem, PA \u2013 Wind Creek Event Center</li>\n\n\n\n<li>May 16: Milwaukee, WI \u2013 Landmark Credit Union Live</li>\n\n\n\n<li>May 19: Denver, CO \u2013 JUNKYARD</li>\n\n\n\n<li>May 20: Salt Lake City, UT \u2013 TheUnion Event Center</li>\n\n\n\n<li>May 21: Las Vegas, NV \u2013 PH Live at Planet Hollywood Resort &amp; Casino</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Opening each night, Castle Rat brings a distinctly different flavor to the lineup. The New York-based band has been steadily building momentum within the underground doom and heavy rock scene, thanks to their theatrical medieval aesthetic and riff-driven storytelling. Fronted by the commanding presence of the \u201cRat Queen,\u201d Castle Rat\u2019s music draws from classic doom metal, heavy rock, and fantasy imagery, creating a live experience that feels both mythic and menacing. Their 2025 release <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/4qaLvJd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">The Bestiary</a></em> has helped propel them onto larger stages, and this tour marks their most high-profile exposure yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Amonklok Conquest stands as more than just a tour announcement \u2014 it\u2019s a statement about metal\u2019s ability to evolve while honoring its roots. By pairing Amon Amarth\u2019s time-tested Viking metal assault with Dethklok\u2019s multimedia chaos and Castle Rat\u2019s rising underground mystique, the tour captures multiple eras and aesthetics of heavy music under one banner. For fans of spectacle, riffs, and unapologetic metal theatrics, this is shaping up to be one of 2026\u2019s must-see tours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Tickets:</strong> <a href=\"https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3DAmon%20Amarth%20%26%20Dethklok\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Get Amon Amarth &#038; Dethklok tickets on Ticketmaster</a></p>\n",

    "title": "Kreator Announce Spring 2026 U.S. Headline Tour With Major Festival Appearances",
    "content": "<p><strong>Kreator 2026 tour plans are officially underway as the German thrash metal legends announce a Spring U.S. headline run with major festival appearances, marking the band\u2019s first full U.S. run since their 2024 campaign.</strong> The tour includes appearances at several of North America\u2019s most high-profile heavy music festivals, including <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/festivals/welcome-to-rockville/\">Welcome to Rockville</a>, <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/festivals/sonic-temple/\">Sonic Temple</a>, and Maryland Deathfest, positioning the run as one of the most significant thrash-focused tours of the year. Tickets and tour roundups live on our <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tours/\">Tours &amp; Tickets hub</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2026 tour launches May 7 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida and runs through May 23 in Huntington, New York, blending headline club dates with major festival stops. For a band whose legacy helped define extreme metal itself, the routing reflects Kreator\u2019s continued relevance across both traditional thrash audiences and modern festival crowds. Tickets will be available via artist presale beginning Thursday, December 11 at 10am local time, with general onsale set for Friday, December 12 at 10am local time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kreator\u2019s presence at <strong>Welcome to Rockville</strong> and <strong>Sonic Temple</strong> places them alongside some of the biggest names in contemporary heavy music, while their appearance at <strong>Maryland Deathfest</strong> reinforces the band\u2019s deep-rooted credibility within the extreme metal underground. This dual positioning \u2014 mainstream festival stages and underground strongholds \u2014 has long been a defining trait of Kreator\u2019s career.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tour also supports the release of Kreator\u2019s sixteenth full-length album, <em>Krushers Of The World</em>, due out January 16 via <a href=\"https://www.nuclearblast.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nuclear Blast Records</a>. The album arrives at a time when the band appear both reflective and ferocious, channeling decades of history into a release that refuses to soften its edges. Fans can <a href=\"https://kreator.bfan.link/krushers-of-the-world\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">pre-order and pre-save the album here</a> and watch the video for the new single <a href=\"https://youtu.be/rv9arEpXBLE?si=z-R_ctw0su7hIulQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">\u201cSatanic Anarchy\u201d</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Founded in the early 1980s in Essen, Germany, Kreator emerged from a bleak post-industrial environment where music served as both escape and confrontation. Drawing inspiration from the New Wave of British Heavy Metal and early American thrash pioneers such as Metallica, Slayer, and Exodus, the band quickly carved out a more aggressive, confrontational strain of thrash metal that would go on to influence generations of extreme musicians.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the decades, Kreator have not only survived but evolved, helping to radicalize thrash metal while inspiring artists across death metal, black metal, and beyond. Bands such as Arch Enemy, Cannibal Corpse, Behemoth, and even Ghost have cited Kreator\u2019s influence, with Ghost\u2019s Papa Emeritus famously joining the band onstage during a 2017 performance of \u201cSatan Is Real.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Krushers Of The World</em> finds the band operating at full force. Tracks such as \u201cSeven Serpents,\u201d \u201cBarbarian,\u201d and \u201cDeathscream\u201d deliver relentless speed and aggression, while mid-tempo crushers like the title track and \u201cSatanic Anarchy\u201d showcase the band\u2019s ability to balance groove with violence. Produced by Jens Bogren at Fascination Street Studios \u2014 who previously worked with Kreator on <em>Phantom Antichrist</em> and <em>Gods Of Violence</em> \u2014 the album sounds massive, sharp, and unapologetically modern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visually, the album also marks a notable evolution. Artwork duties were handled by acclaimed artist Zbigniew Bielak, known for his work with Ghost, who reinterprets classic Kreator visual motifs into a dense, occult-laden tapestry that pays homage to the band\u2019s past while pushing their aesthetic forward. The result is a sleeve design that rewards close inspection and reinforces the album\u2019s thematic weight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Kreator prepare to take <em>Krushers Of The World</em> on the road, the Spring 2026 tour stands as a reminder of the band\u2019s enduring power. More than four decades into their career, Kreator remain a vital, intimidating force \u2014 equally at home leveling festival fields and demolishing packed clubs, still driven by the same uncompromising intensity that defined their earliest days.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Kreator \u2014 Spring 2026 U.S. Tour Dates</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>May 7 \u2014 Fort Lauderdale, FL \u2014 Revolution Live*</li>\n\n\n\n<li>May 8 \u2014 Daytona Beach, FL \u2014 Welcome to Rockville</li>\n\n\n\n<li>May 10 \u2014 Atlanta, GA \u2014 The Masquerade</li>\n\n\n\n<li>May 11 \u2014 Knoxville, TN \u2014 The Mill &amp; Mine</li>\n\n\n\n<li>May 12 \u2014 Raleigh, NC \u2014 The Ritz</li>\n\n\n\n<li>May 14 \u2014 Worcester, MA \u2014 Palladium</li>\n\n\n\n<li>May 15 \u2014 McKees Rocks, PA \u2014 Roxian Theatre</li>\n\n\n\n<li>May 16 \u2014 Columbus, OH \u2014 Sonic Temple*</li>\n\n\n\n<li>May 18 \u2014 Davenport, IA \u2014 Capitol Theatre</li>\n\n\n\n<li>May 19 \u2014 Minneapolis, MN \u2014 First Avenue</li>\n\n\n\n<li>May 20 \u2014 Chicago, IL \u2014 Riviera Theatre</li>\n\n\n\n<li>May 22 \u2014 Baltimore, MD \u2014 Maryland Deathfest*</li>\n\n\n\n<li>May 23 \u2014 Huntington, NY \u2014 Paramount</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>*Festival appearance</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Kreator Online</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/KreatorOfficial\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Facebook</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kreatorofficial/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Instagram</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/Kreator/featured\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">YouTube</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://x.com/kreator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">X</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.kreator-terrorzone.de/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Official Website</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n<p>Festival links: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/welcome-to-rockville-2026/\">Welcome to Rockville 2026</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/sonic-temple-2026/\">Sonic Temple 2026</a></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Tickets:</strong> <a href=\"https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3DKreator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Get Kreator tickets on Ticketmaster</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More from Metal Mantra:</strong> <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/\">Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026</a></p>\n",

    "title": "Bloodywood Announce 2026 \u201cSystem of a Brown\u201d U.S. Tour With The Pretty Wild, Ladrones, and Ankor",
    "content": "<p><strong>Indian folk metal trailblazers Bloodywood have announced their 2026 North American headline run, the \u201cSystem of a Brown Tour,\u201d marking a major milestone in the band\u2019s global ascent and their first full-length U.S. headline tour to date.</strong> The announcement follows a breakout year that saw the New Delhi-based group move from viral success to sold-out venues, major festival stages, and high-profile support slots alongside some of modern metal\u2019s most visible acts. Tickets and tour roundups live on our <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tours/\">Tours &amp; Tickets hub</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Produced by Live Nation, the 25-city tour launches April 10, 2026 in Des Moines, Iowa and runs through mid-May, wrapping in Columbus, Ohio. Bloodywood will be joined by an intentionally diverse support lineup featuring U.S. metalcore act <strong>The Pretty Wild</strong>, Mexican \u201cFlow Pesado\u201d rock collective <strong>Ladrones</strong>, and Catalonian melodic metal band <strong>Ankor</strong>, reinforcing the tour\u2019s global scope and cross-genre appeal. Tickets and VIP packages will be available via <a href=\"https://www.livenation.com/artist/K8vZ917_RDV/bloodywood-events\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">LiveNation.com</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bloodywood.net/tour\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bloodywood.net</a>, with artist presales beginning Tuesday, December 9 and general onsale opening Friday, December 12 at 10am local time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The \u201cSystem of a Brown Tour\u201d represents a full-circle moment for Bloodywood\u2019s relationship with North American audiences. In Summer 2025, the band completed a sold-out U.S. run supporting BABYMETAL, introducing their culturally fused sound to thousands of new fans night after night. That momentum carried into Europe, where Bloodywood served as direct support for Halestorm, further proving their ability to hold their own on large stages across continents. This headline tour is the culmination of that steady rise, bringing Bloodywood\u2019s complete live vision to U.S. venues for the first time and expanding their footprint within the broader <a href=\"/news/metal-tours/\">metal tours coverage</a> landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cOur spring headline run of the U.S. will be an epic full circle moment,\u201d says rapper and vocalist Raoul Kerr. \u201cIt started this summer supporting BABYMETAL, and now it culminates in a run where we bring our full-length set to the U.S. for the first time. It\u2019s the best songs from our new album and the best of our first album \u2014 it\u2019s the kind of set that pushes the limit of any venue to the max.\u201d For longtime followers of the band, the tour promises a definitive live statement rather than a scaled-down support performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Festival appearances play a key role in anchoring the tour\u2019s visibility, with Bloodywood set to appear at <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/sick-new-world/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://metal-mantra.com/sick-new-world/\">Sick New World</a> in Las Vegas, <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/welcome-to-rockville-returns-in-2026/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://metal-mantra.com/welcome-to-rockville-returns-in-2026/\">Welcome to Rockville</a> in Daytona Beach, and <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/sonic-temple-2026-festival-coverage/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://metal-mantra.com/sonic-temple-2026-festival-coverage/\">Sonic Temple</a> in Columbus. These bookings place the band alongside the biggest names in contemporary heavy music while exposing them to massive crossover audiences, further accelerating their momentum in the U.S. market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The support lineup reinforces Bloodywood\u2019s identity-driven approach to heavy music. Rather than stacking stylistically similar acts, the tour brings together artists representing different regions and perspectives within the modern metal landscape. The Pretty Wild deliver a modern U.S. metalcore sound built for high-energy club rooms, Ladrones blend hip-hop cadence with heavy rock under their self-described \u201cFlow Pesado\u201d banner, and Ankor contribute a polished melodic metal edge rooted in the European scene. The result is a contrast-driven bill that mirrors the evolving global nature of heavy music.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bloodywood\u2019s reputation as a must-see live act has been solidified by both fan response and critical recognition. Outlets including Revolver, Metal Injection, Consequence, Guitar World, and PASTE have highlighted the band\u2019s ability to translate cultural fusion into an explosive and cohesive live experience. Recent sold-out performances in London underscored that reputation, with crowd reactions demonstrating the universal resonance of Bloodywood\u2019s sound regardless of geography.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Bloodywood - Dana Dan (Live From London)\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/msednxPZMIY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The tour also continues to support the band\u2019s latest album, <em>NU DELHI</em>, released in 2025 via Fearless Records. The album functions as both a love letter to the band\u2019s home region and a broader statement on the future of global metal, blending nu metal, modern metalcore, melodic hard rock, and Indian folk elements into a fingerprint-distinct sound.

Tickets and tour roundups live on our <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tours/\">Tours &amp; Tickets hub</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tour will hit major amphitheaters, arenas, and outdoor venues across the U.S. and Canada beginning in early June and running well into August. This marks Avenged Sevenfold\u2019s first major extended run since supporting their critically acclaimed album <em>Life Is But a Dream\u2026</em>, while Good Charlotte returns to the national spotlight with fresh momentum and longstanding fan demand.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A Bold Pairing: Metal Meets Pop-Punk</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Though Avenged Sevenfold and Good Charlotte come from different sonic backgrounds, both bands dominated the 2000s alternative scene and built multi-generational followings. Fans online are already calling this one of the most unexpected \u2014 and exciting \u2014 tour pairings of the last decade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Avenged Sevenfold continue to push creative boundaries with experimental production, immersive live shows, and setlists that span their full career. Good Charlotte\u2019s return brings anthems like \u201cThe Anthem,\u201d \u201cLifestyles of the Rich &amp; Famous,\u201d and \u201cI Just Wanna Live\u201d back to major stages, tapping into intense nostalgia alongside new material.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Tour Dates</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The full list of dates is being shared across participating outlets, with stops confirmed in major markets including Denver, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Toronto, Dallas, and more. A complete date list is expected with the official Ticketmaster and venue rollouts later this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Tickets + Presale Info</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Presales begin this week through the bands&#8217; official fan clubs and Live Nation, with general on-sale dates set for Friday. VIP upgrades, meet-and-greet options, and limited-edition merch bundles are expected to be available for both groups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the combined drawing power of both artists \u2014 and widespread coverage from every major rock publication \u2014 demand is projected to be extremely high. Fans are strongly encouraged to secure tickets during presale windows.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why This Tour Matters</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is more than a typical co-headline run \u2014 it\u2019s a collision of two influential scenes. A7X brings progressive, theatrical metal; Good Charlotte delivers decades-defining pop-punk energy. Together, they represent a generation that shaped alternative music from Warped Tour to stadium metal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For longtime fans \u2014 especially millennials who lived through both bands\u2019 rise \u2014 this tour is a rare chance to see two icons share the same stage during a full nationwide run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stay tuned for updates, full tour dates, and coverage as more details emerge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tickets:</strong> <a href=\"https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Davenged%20sevenfold\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Get Avenged Sevenfold 2026 tour tickets</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>More Metal Mantra: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tours/\">Metal Tours &amp; Tickets Hub</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-metal-tours-coming-in-2026/\">Top 10 Metal Tours in 2026</a></p>\n",

    "title": "Why Dave Mustaine Says a Full\u2011Lineup Megadeth Reunion Won\u2019t Happen",
    "content": "<p>\nThe announcement of <strong>Megadeth</strong>\u2019s farewell tour and final album has set off a flurry of speculation among thrash\u2011metal fans.  After four decades of influence and innovation, the band is preparing to release its self\u2011titled swan song and embark on a multi\u2011continent run, culminating with what many assume will be the last Megadeth concert.  In a candid interview with SiriusXM\u2019s <em>Trunk Nation</em>, however, frontman <strong>Dave Mustaine</strong> poured cold water on hopes for a full\u2011lineup reunion at that final show.  The longtime guitarist and vocalist explained that the \u201cbehaviour\u201d of one former member makes it impossible to gather all surviving alumni on one stage.  Mustaine\u2019s comments shine a light on the practical and ethical issues that come with celebrating a sprawling legacy while honouring the current musicians who carried the band through its later years.<br />\n More metal news: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/news/\">News hub</a>.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What We Know About Megadeth\u2019s Farewell</h2>\n<p>\nMegadeth\u2019s final chapter has been unfolding in stages.  Earlier this week the band announced <em>Megadeth:\u202fBehind&nbsp;the&nbsp;Mask</em>, a global one\u2011night cinema event scheduled for January&nbsp;22,&nbsp;2026.  The film will offer a career\u2011spanning retrospective and premiere the group\u2019s long\u2011rumored final studio album, set for release the following day.  Tickets for the movie go on sale December&nbsp;11, and the event will stream in more than a thousand theatres worldwide.  In a separate announcement, Megadeth revealed a sprawling farewell tour that will take them across the United States, Canada, South America and Europe throughout 2026.  For a band that has cycled through dozens of members since its 1983 founding, the opportunity to cap that tour with a full\u2011lineup reunion seemed like a fitting final act.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn his <em>Trunk Nation</em> interview, Mustaine acknowledged that fans have been asking whether the last show could include past guitarists and drummers.  He cited the example of <strong>Marty&nbsp;Friedman</strong>, the virtuoso who helped write classics such as <em>Rust&nbsp;in&nbsp;Peace</em> and <em>Countdown&nbsp;to&nbsp;Extinction</em>.  Friedman briefly rejoined the band in early&nbsp;2024 for a special performance in Japan and left the door open to further collaboration.  \u201cThat was brilliant, and I love Marty,\u201d Mustaine said, calling their time together a \u201cvery intense relationship.\u201d  It was the first sign that the farewell campaign might include special guests.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why a Full Reunion Isn\u2019t on the Table</h2>\n<p>\nWhen pressed by host Eddie&nbsp;Trunk on the possibility of a full reunion, Mustaine demurred.  He said that one former member\u2019s past behaviour makes such an event impossible.  Mustaine did not name names, and he refused to elaborate on what that behaviour entailed.  Instead, he framed the decision as a matter of fairness to the musicians who currently fill Megadeth\u2019s ranks: inviting back a high\u2011profile alumnus could undermine the contributions of guitarist Kiko&nbsp;Loureiro, drummer Dirk&nbsp;Verbeuren and bassist James&nbsp;LoMenzo, all of whom have logged years on the road and in the studio with Mustaine.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe guitarist clarified that exceptions like the appearance of Marty&nbsp;Friedman make sense when the chemistry is right.  But Megadeth\u2019s long list of former members includes players who left under contentious circumstances or were dismissed for personal and professional reasons.  Mustaine suggested that reopening old wounds at the farewell show would be counterproductive.  Additionally, some alumni are no longer alive; drummer Gar&nbsp;Samuelson died in 1999, and more recently the community mourned the passing of former drummer Nick&nbsp;Menza.  That reality makes a truly comprehensive reunion impossible.\n</p>\n<p>\nSpeculation immediately turned to which former member Mustaine was referencing.  Given his past public disagreements with former bassist <strong>David Ellefson</strong>\u2014dismissed from the band in 2021 after an online misconduct scandal\u2014many fans assume the comment alludes to him.  However, Mustaine refused to confirm or deny that theory, and Ellefson has said in recent interviews that he\u2019s not expecting an invitation back.  In fact, Ellefson defended his ex\u2011bandmate\u2019s right to make the final call, noting that if Mustaine needs to walk away from the band for his own well\u2011being, he should do so \u201cwith dignity and grace.\u201d  The focus, then, remains squarely on the current lineup\u2019s ability to deliver the thrash metal ferocity that has defined Megadeth for decades.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Balancing Legacy and Loyalty</h2>\n<p>\nFor heavy\u2011music historians, the reunion debate raises broader questions about how legacy bands honour their past.  <strong>Black Sabbath</strong> famously ended their career with the original lineup that birthed heavy metal, and fans often expect similar closure from other icons.  But Megadeth is unique: over 40 years the band has employed more than two dozen musicians, and Mustaine has always been the primary creative force.  In that sense, the brand is less a fixed lineup than a vessel for his songwriting.  A \u201cclassic lineup\u201d reunion might appease long\u2011time fans but risk alienating the musicians who kept the band afloat during lean years.\n</p>\n<p>\nMustaine also hinted that the final concert could be emotionally taxing.  He joked that management should \u201cbook some fake dates\u201d after the farewell run so that he doesn\u2019t walk on stage and \u201cblubber like a 175\u2011pound wuss.\u201d  That self\u2011deprecating remark underscores the stakes: for a bandleader who has spent his life on tour, saying goodbye will be difficult even without the added drama of coordinating a parade of former members.  Fans may not get to see every ex\u2011Megadeth player take a bow, but they will witness Mustaine and his current bandmates close a chapter with conviction.\n</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Comes Next for Fans</h2>\n<p>\nWhile Mustaine\u2019s comments may disappoint some, there is still plenty for thrash devotees to anticipate.  The forthcoming album\u2014rumoured to be self\u2011titled\u2014will likely serve as the definitive statement of Megadeth\u2019s current lineup.  If past releases like <em>Dystopia</em> and <em>The Sick, the Dying\u2026 and the Dead!</em> are any indicator, the new record will blend ferocious riffing with politically charged lyrics.  The cinematic experience <em>Megadeth:&nbsp;Behind&nbsp;the&nbsp;Mask</em> will offer unprecedented insight into the band\u2019s history, with archival footage, interviews and a full preview of the album before its official release.  And the farewell tour itself will provide fans worldwide with a final opportunity to witness songs like \u201cHoly&nbsp;Wars,\u201d \u201cPeace&nbsp;Sells\u201d and \u201cSymphony of Destruction\u201d played with the precision and intensity that made Megadeth one of the \u201cbig four\u201d of American thrash metal.\n</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the decision to forego a full\u2011lineup reunion reflects both practical considerations and a commitment to the musicians who have weathered recent years alongside Mustaine. As he prepares to hang up the Megadeth banner, he appears focused on honouring his current collaborators, presenting a unified front for the band\u2019s final act and avoiding the interpersonal conflicts that often accompany nostalgia\u2011driven reunions. Whether fans accept that rationale or continue to clamour for cameos, the farewell cycle promises to be one of the most closely watched stories in heavy music.

After re-introducing themselves earlier this fall with the crushing single \u201cI\u2019ll Find the Dark,\u201d their first track since 2022\u2019s output, the band has now officially announced their long-awaited new album <strong><em>Where the Light Leaves</em></strong>.

Their earlier albums \u2014 from 2017\u2019s <em>Pain Again</em> and 2019\u2019s <em>In Darkness</em> to 2022\u2019s <em>Scars for You to Remember</em> \u2014 showed their continual evolution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With <em>Where the Light Leaves</em>, the band digs deeper. Produced by longtime collaborator Josh Schroeder, the album channels ferocity, atmosphere, and emotional weight. Fans can expect destructive hardcore energy, nu-metal-tinged grooves, and haunting lyrics \u2014 a record that reflects both pain and catharsis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Varials have already proven themselves on tours with some of the scene\u2019s hardest-hitting acts \u2014 and this album promises to bring that live intensity to recorded form again.

More metal news: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/news/\">News hub</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The song races forward with high speed thrash riffs, a massive, chant along chorus and a searing guitar solo, packing everything fans love about modern Kreator into just three and a half minutes of pure metal aggression.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The official \u201cSatanic Anarchy\u201d music video dives deep into frontman Mille Petrozza\u2019s passion for classic horror cinema, paying tribute to Clive Barker\u2019s 1987 cult favorite Hellraiser.

I hope you will like our brand new video for the song \u2018Satanic Anarchy\u2019 off our new album Krushers Of The World.

The narrative part of the video takes us back to the cinematic masterpiece Hellraiser by the great Clive Barker. This is not a remake or a sequel, it is an echo, a tribute to the raw imagination of eighties horror where pleasure, pain and chaos shared the same key.

    "content": "<article class=\"mm-article mm-news mm-a7x-magic\">\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.avengedsevenfold.com/news/-magic-out-now\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Avenged Sevenfold</strong></a> have pulled another signature left hook, surprise-dropping a brand-new song titled <strong>\u201cMagic\u201d</strong> \u2014 a collaborative track created for <strong>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</strong> and released alongside the game\u2019s Season 01 launch content. Without warning, the band unleashed the track across streaming platforms and a fully immersive 360\u00b0 visual experience, sending fans scrambling for headphones and dissecting clues the way only the A7X community can. More reviews: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/review/\">Review hub</a>.</p>\n<p>This marks the band\u2019s first new music since their 2023 experimental record <em>Life Is but a Dream\u2026</em>, and while <strong>\u201cMagic\u201d</strong> definitely inherits some of that album\u2019s mind-warping DNA, it pushes into a different, more aggressive direction tailored for the Cold War\u2013themed chaos of <strong>Black Ops 7</strong>. For fans wondering what the next phase of A7X might sound like, this track is a loud, glitchy clue.</p>\n<h2>\u201cMagic\u201d Track Review: Cyber-Psychedelic Heavy Metal from Avenged Sevenfold</h2>\n<p><strong>\u201cMagic\u201d</strong> kicks off with a sharp digital snarl \u2014 glitchy electronics, distorted vocal layers, and a creeping sense of unease that fits directly into the <em>Black Ops</em> universe. Then the real hit comes: a <strong>crushing, palm-muted groove</strong> that drops like a bunker buster. Synyster Gates\u2019 guitar tone is dense and warped, like it has been routed through a malfunctioning AI, and the main riff swings between industrial chug, progressive twists, and psychedelic math-metal freak-outs.</p>\n<h3>M. Shadows\u2019 Vocal Performance</h3>\n<p><strong>M. Shadows</strong> leans heavily into his modern vocal palette \u2014 half-crooned, half-snarled, processed but still expressive. The chorus slips into a surreal, almost hypnotic melody, layered with harmonies that feel both eerie and triumphant. It\u2019s catchy but unsettling, the musical equivalent of staring down the barrel of a mind-control experiment, which fits the <strong>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</strong> vibe perfectly.</p>\n<h3>Rhythm Section &amp; Production</h3>\n<p>Behind the chaos, <strong>Brooks Wackerman</strong> drives the track with explosive, stuttering drum patterns that feel almost programmed, blurring the line between organic thrash energy and cinematic battlefield tension. <strong>Johnny Christ</strong> locks in with a thick, mechanical bass pulse that keeps the song grounded while the guitars and electronics spiral outward.</p>\n<p>Production-wise, <strong>\u201cMagic\u201d</strong> sits somewhere between the futuristic glitch-metal of \u201cGame Over,\u201d the multi-layered psychedelic weirdness of \u201cCosmic,\u201d and the explosive, riff-driven swagger of the <em>Hail to the King</em> era. It\u2019s weird, heavy, and unmistakably Avenged Sevenfold.</p>\n<h2>Avenged Sevenfold &amp; Call of Duty: A Long-Running Alliance</h2>\n<p><strong>Avenged Sevenfold</strong> and <strong>Call of Duty</strong> have been creatively intertwined for over a decade. From earlier soundtrack placements to in-game appearances, the partnership has become a recurring crossover moment for both communities. With <strong>\u201cMagic\u201d</strong>, the band pushes that relationship further by crafting a track that mirrors the themes of <strong>Black Ops 7</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cold War paranoia and psychological warfare</li>\n<li>Digital espionage and unseen manipulation</li>\n<li>High-tension, no-safe-space battlefield energy</li>\n<li>Blurring the line between reality and experiment</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The lyrics and atmosphere feel perfectly aligned with <em>Black Ops</em>\u2019 trademark narrative style \u2014 cryptic, conspiratorial, and a little unhinged. It plays like a soundtrack to mind games and double crosses, rather than a generic \u201cmetal song for a video game.\u201d</p>\n<h2>Is \u201cMagic\u201d a One-Off or the Start of a New A7X Era?</h2>\n<p>The surprise release of <strong>\u201cMagic\u201d</strong> has fans speculating about whether this track is a standalone single or an early signal of where Avenged Sevenfold might be heading next. The band has a long history of playing by their own rules \u2014 dropping teasers, cryptic visuals, and unconventional rollouts instead of traditional album cycles.</p>\n<p>Releasing a high-profile collaboration track like this, outside of a typical album announcement, hints that A7X could be experimenting with more <strong>singles, soundtracks, and multimedia projects</strong> around whatever they have planned for 2026 and beyond. Historically, when Avenged Sevenfold start releasing puzzle-piece songs, more pieces tend to follow.</p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts: \u201cMagic\u201d as a Statement Track</h2>\n<p>Ultimately, <strong>\u201cMagic\u201d</strong> is a bold, chaotic, immersive slab of modern <strong>Avenged Sevenfold</strong>. It blends their most experimental instincts with a return to heavy, riff-driven aggression, wrapped in a cinematic shell that fits the <strong>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</strong> universe perfectly.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s dark, glitchy, and psychedelic. It feels designed to live in your headphones and inside the game at the same time. For longtime A7X fans, it delivers the kind of high-concept, high-drama metal they\u2019ve come to expect. For Black Ops players, it\u2019s the kind of track that makes late-night sessions feel even more intense.</p>\n<p>If this is the tone of what\u2019s coming next from Avenged Sevenfold, 2026 might get very loud, very weird, and very fun.</p>\n</article>\n\n\n<p><br><em>Explore more <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/avenged-sevenfold/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/avenged-sevenfold/\">Avenged Sevenfold</a> coverage.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Avenged Sevenfold - Magic (Official Lyric Video)\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yd3Uw0nrWyM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n<p><strong>Listen/Buy:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Avenged+Sevenfold+Surprise-Release+New+Track+%E2%80%9CMagic%E2%80%9D+for+Call+of+Duty++Black+Ops&#038;tag=metalmantra-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Find on Amazon</a></p>\n",

More metal news: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/news/\">News hub</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Teen metal band <strong>Chained Saint</strong> \u2014 comprised of <strong>Ethan Kahn</strong> (guitar), <strong>Sebastian De Avila</strong> (bass), <strong>Cameron Cottrell</strong> (drums) and <strong>Sean Sterling</strong> (vocals) \u2014 continue their rise as one of the most exciting young forces in modern heavy music. Born in a South Florida garage in 2022, the band fuse old-school thrash metal energy with a modern, hard-hitting edge that speaks directly to the realities of today\u2019s youth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In just a short time, Chained Saint have earned praise from heavy-music tastemakers including <strong>Revolver</strong>, <strong>Guitar World</strong>, <strong>Loudwire</strong>, <strong>Metal Injection</strong>, and <strong>Miami New Times</strong>, while Judas Priest legend <strong>Rob Halford</strong> has publicly backed the band\u2019s shredding chops. Their breakout single <strong>\u201cAnimosity\u201d</strong> landed in rotation on <strong>SiriusXM Liquid Metal</strong> and soundtracked the <strong>WWE 2K24 DLC 4</strong> trailer, putting the teen thrashers squarely in front of a global metal audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside their studio success, the band have been building a reputation as a must-see live act. In 2024, Chained Saint hit major stages at <strong>Welcome to Rockville</strong>, <strong>Rocklahoma</strong>, <strong>Louder Than Life</strong>, and the revived <strong>Vans Warped Tour</strong>. Severe weather cut their Louder Than Life set short, but the day still turned into a viral moment when <strong>Slaughter to Prevail</strong> personally invited vocalist Sean Sterling to join them onstage, creating a piece of live metal history fans are still talking about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more breaking heavy-music coverage, festival updates, and underground discoveries, explore the <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/category/metal-news/\">Metal Mantra Metal News</a> hub and dive deeper into our <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/thrash-metal/\">thrash metal</a> coverage.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">About the Chained Saint Live at the Whisky a Go Go EP</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, Chained Saint level up again with the release of their new live collection, the <strong>Chained Saint Live at the Whisky a Go Go EP</strong>. Recorded on August 15 at the legendary Los Angeles venue, the EP documents the band\u2019s second performance on the Whisky stage and captures the kind of high-voltage intensity that only a hungry, young metal band can generate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>Chained Saint Live at the Whisky a Go Go EP</strong> captures the band\u2019s raw, youthful intensity and showcases why they are one of the most talked-about new acts in modern thrash metal. Across the EP, Chained Saint channel the ferocity of classic \u201980s thrash metal while staying locked into a modern, precise and punishing sound. It\u2019s a snapshot of a teenage band stepping fully into their power, bridging the gap between their debut album <em>Blindside</em> and the new music set to arrive in early 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fans of the <strong>Chained Saint Live at the Whisky a Go Go EP</strong> will immediately recognize the tight musicianship and high-energy performance that has fueled the band\u2019s rapid rise. The band says the <strong>Chained Saint Live at the Whisky a Go Go EP</strong> represents their most accurate live snapshot yet, giving listeners a full-throttle experience of what the band delivers onstage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fans can keep up with the band and hear more via the official <a href=\"https://www.chainedsaint.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chained Saint website</a>, stream the album <em>Blindside</em> on <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/2083zoQu1pm0tPTyLms72N\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Spotify</a>, or explore videos on the band\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@chainedsaint\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YouTube channel</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To discover more music, social links, tour dates, and streaming options in one place, hit the band\u2019s official <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/chainedsaint\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Chained Saint Linktree</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Band on the New Live EP</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe love playing in Los Angeles and love playing at the Whisky a Go Go,\u201d the band shares. \u201cBesides being an iconic venue, it\u2019s intimate, and the energy is great. And there\u2019s nothing like playing in front of a packed house.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe talked about releasing a live EP between the <em>Blindside</em> album and the new music we\u2019re releasing early next year. The August 15 show at the Whisky provided the perfect opportunity to show what it\u2019s like to see us live. We were also able to capture the set on video, for all of the people who haven\u2019t had the opportunity to see us live yet.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><em>Live at the Whisky a Go Go</em> EP Track Listing</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>\u201cFree Reign\u201d</li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u201c1000 Tons\u201d</li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u201cDark Side of the Cross\u201d</li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u201cStronger Than Stone (Blindside)\u201d</li>\n\n\n\n<li>\u201cAnimosity\u201d</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">About Chained Saint and <em>Blindside</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Chained Saint formed in a South Florida garage in the summer of 2022 and quickly built a reputation for fusing the raw, organic riff power of classic \u201980s thrash with contemporary heaviness. Their debut album <strong><em>Blindside</em></strong>, released via independent label <strong>Patriark Records</strong>, distills that sound into eight tightly written tracks that hit with both technical precision and emotional weight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Produced by <strong>William DuVall</strong> of <strong>Alice In Chains</strong>, <em>Blindside</em> was recorded and mixed entirely to analog tape. There were no computers used in the recording sessions, no AI, and no studio trickery \u2014 just real riffs played by real musicians pushing themselves to capture the most honest performance possible. The result is a modern thrash metal statement that still feels timeless.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the raging opener <strong>\u201cAnimosity\u201d</strong> to cuts like <strong>\u201cStronger Than Stone (Blindside)\u201d</strong>, <strong>\u201cNeanderthal\u201d</strong>, and <strong>\u201cFree Reign\u201d</strong>, the record showcases the band\u2019s ability to write hooks, riffs, and choruses that stick while keeping everything drenched in high-gain fury. For fans of classic thrash, new-school shred, and youth-driven heavy metal, Chained Saint are very much a band to watch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Metal Mantra will continue to track Chained Saint\u2019s rise across future releases, festival appearances, and tour announcements.

Both tracks are available digitally now and will see physical releases on vinyl, cassette and Japan-exclusive SHM-CD. Guitarist Slash hinted that a full-length album is in the works, though he noted it will happen organically.</p>\n<h2>Megadeth Announce Global Cinematic Event Ahead of Final Album</h2>\n<p>Thrash veterans <strong>Megadeth</strong> have teamed with Trafalgar Releasing for <em>Megadeth: Behind the Mask</em>, a one-night cinematic experience premiering January 22, 2026.

    "title": "Metal & Hard Rock News \u2013 December 4, 2025: Tours, Tributes, Cancellations & Chaos in Heavy Music",
    "content": "<article>\n<p>Today\u2019s heavy-music news cycle is packed: new 2026 tour routes, charity moves from arena giants, a major Australian festival cancellation, tech-death violence, gaming crossovers, and a posthumous honor for one of metal\u2019s founding voices. Here\u2019s your Metal Mantra daily rundown of what\u2019s happening across <strong>metal, hard rock, metalcore, and tech-death</strong> right now. Catch more in the <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/\">latest Rundown</a>.</p>\n<h2>Mammoth Announce 23-Date 2026 North American Tour</h2>\n<p><strong>Mammoth</strong> are locking in 2026 early with a 23-date North American tour that hits theaters and casino venues from early March through early April. Wolfgang Van Halen is clearly treating Mammoth as a full-time, road-tested band now, not a side project \u2014 and this run solidifies that energy.</p>\n<p>The trek brings along Tennessee alt-metal veterans <strong>10 Years</strong> plus rising UK rockers <strong>James and the Cold Gun</strong>, making this a smart mix of modern hard rock and melodic heft. Expect tight rooms, big choruses, and plenty of focus on the Mammoth catalog rather than nostalgia trips. For fans eyeing the <a href=\"https://mammoth.band/pages/tour\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Mammoth 2026 tour</strong></a>, this looks like one of the more reliable hard-rock tickets of the early year, especially if you prefer guitars over backing tracks and casinos over crowded festival fields.</p>\n<h2>The Amity Affliction &amp; August Burns Red Bring the Spring Horizons Tour</h2>\n<p>On the metalcore side, <strong>The Amity Affliction</strong> and <strong>August Burns Red</strong> are teaming up for the co-headline <strong>Spring Horizons Tour</strong> next spring. The package is pure crowd-killer: support from <strong>Boundaries</strong> and <strong>Heavensgate</strong>, plus a key festival stop at <strong>Sonic Temple</strong>.</p>\n<p>Fans can expect Amity\u2019s emotionally charged metalcore stacked against August Burns Red\u2019s technical riff assaults, with Boundaries and Heavensgate pushing the openers into full-on breakdown territory. This is exactly the kind of smart, mid-to-large room routing that keeps the metalcore ecosystem alive \u2014 big enough to feel like an event, intimate enough that circle pits still feel personal. Get tix &amp; vip at <a href=\"https://tix.soundrink.com/tours/the-springs-horizon-tour-2026\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Soundrink.</a></p>\n<h2>Foo Fighters Schedule Birthday Benefit Show for LA\u2019s Unhoused</h2>\n<p><strong>Foo Fighters</strong> are starting 2026 on a different kind of heavy. The band have booked a January 14 benefit show at LA\u2019s Kia Forum \u2014 the date doubles as <strong>Dave Grohl</strong>\u2019s 57th birthday \u2014 with proceeds going to <strong>Hope The Mission</strong> and <strong>Los Angeles Mission</strong> to support unhoused Angelenos.</p>\n<p>The Foo Fighters have a long track record of using their platform for benefit shows, and this \u201c<strong>Foo Fighters Kia Forum charity concert</strong>\u201d continues that legacy. At a time when arena tours are under fire for VIP bloat and sky-high ticket fees, seeing a major rock act anchor a birthday around fundraising hits differently. Expect this to sell out instantly!</p>\n<h2>Parkway Drive Cancel Park Waves 2026 Festival Over Rising Costs</h2>\n<p>In more sobering news, Australian metalcore pillars <strong>Parkway Drive</strong> have officially cancelled their traveling <strong>Park Waves 2026</strong> festival. The band are blaming soaring touring and production costs for shutting down the run before it really started. The festival was set to feature <strong>The Amity Affliction</strong>, <strong>Northlane</strong>, and <strong>Alpha Wolf</strong>, making it one of the strongest Australian heavy packages on paper for next year.</p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t just a single event dying off. The <strong>Park Waves festival cancellation</strong> is another bright red warning sign for mid-to-large scale metal festivals worldwide. When a band as established as Parkway Drive can\u2019t make the math work for a domestic festival tour, you know something\u2019s off in the economics of live heavy music \u2014 from freight and fuel to venue overhead and insurance. For fans, it\u2019s a reminder: when a tour or festival you care about pops up, don\u2019t sleep on tickets. The window between \u201cannounced\u201d and \u201ccancelled\u201d is getting shorter.</p>\n<h2>Slipknot\u2019s Clown Launches Vernearth, a Slipknot-Themed Minecraft Realm</h2>\n<p>From canceled festivals to digital worlds: <strong>Slipknot</strong> percussionist and visual architect <strong>Clown</strong> has launched <strong>Vernearth</strong>, a Slipknot-themed <strong>Minecraft</strong> realm running in 45-day seasons. The server features custom survival, PvP, creative, and hardcore challenge modes, giving Maggots a new way to live inside the band\u2019s aesthetic instead of just streaming tracks.</p>\n<p>This \u201c<strong>Slipknot Vernearth Minecraft server</strong>\u201d move makes sense: the overlap between heavy music and gaming culture is huge, and younger fans often find bands through Twitch, Discord, and game mods rather than traditional channels. It\u2019s another example of legacy bands evolving beyond albums and tours into full-on multimedia ecosystems \u2014 graphic novels, horror experiences, and now, blocky digital chaos curated by Clown himself.</p>\n<h2>Iron Maiden Mark 50 Years with New Fender Signature Line</h2>\n<p>On the classic-metal front, <strong>Iron Maiden</strong> are celebrating 50 years by teaming up with Fender for a new signature line built around three of the band\u2019s core players: <strong>Dave Murray</strong>, <strong>Janick Gers</strong>, and <strong>Steve Harris</strong>. The collection includes high-end <strong>Stratocaster</strong> models for Murray and Gers, plus a new <strong>Precision Bass</strong> honoring Harris\u2019s unmistakable galloping low-end.</p>\n<p>For guitar and bass nerds this drop is huge. These aren\u2019t random vanity models \u2014 they\u2019re built to mirror the battle-tested rigs that powered decades of tours and albums. Expect every YouTube shredder with a Union Jack flag in their background to be demoing these as soon as they land.</p>\n<h2>The Zenith Passage Drop \u201cFleshbound Reliquary\u201d and Hit the Road</h2>\n<p>Technical death metal gets its turn via <strong>The Zenith Passage</strong>, who\u2019ve unleashed a new single titled <strong>\u201cFleshbound Reliquary\u201d</strong>. It\u2019s the band\u2019s first track with drummer <strong>Max Sepulveda</strong>, and early reactions suggest it doubles down on the intricate, sci-fi-adjacent brutality fans expect.</p>\n<p>Alongside the single, The Zenith Passage have announced a run of U.S. dates with <strong>Entheos</strong> and <strong>Fallujah</strong>, essentially building a tech-death mini-festival in club form. If you\u2019re into polyrhythms, dissonant chords, and riffs that sound like a collapsing server room, this <strong>The Zenith Passage Fleshbound Reliquary tour</strong> might be your next pilgrimage.</p>\n<h2>Alice In Chains Pulled Into PETA\u2019s \u201cBetty in Chains\u201d Elephant Campaign</h2>\n<p>In one of the stranger crossovers of the week, <strong>Alice In Chains</strong> have been pulled into a new <strong>PETA</strong> campaign asking the band to temporarily rename themselves <strong>\u201cBetty in Chains\u201d</strong>. The move is intended to raise awareness for an elderly circus elephant named Betty, which PETA claims is in urgent need of sanctuary care.</p>\n<p>Whether or not the band respond, the \u201c<strong>Alice In Chains Betty in Chains</strong>\u201d headline is already doing the awareness work PETA wants: putting animal-welfare discussions in front of rock and grunge fans who might not be plugged into circus-related activism.\u00a0</p>\n<h2>Ozzy Osbourne Receives Posthumous Lord Mayor\u2019s Award in Birmingham</h2>\n<p>Finally, a moment of respect: the late <strong>Ozzy Osbourne</strong> is being posthumously honored with the <strong>Lord Mayor\u2019s Award</strong> in Birmingham on what would have been his 77th birthday. The recognition salutes his defining role in heavy metal as frontman of <strong>Black Sabbath</strong> and his decades representing Birmingham on the world stage.</p>\n<p>For fans, this <strong>Ozzy Osbourne Birmingham Lord Mayor\u2019s Award</strong> feels like official acknowledgment of what the community has known for years \u2014 that the \u201cPrince of Darkness\u201d is also one of the city\u2019s most important cultural exports. It\u2019s a reminder that without Birmingham\u2019s factories, pubs, and grey skies, there might never have been heavy metal as we know it.</p>\n<h2>Stay Plugged Into the Noise</h2>\n<p>From new 2026 tour routes and high-end signature instruments to canceled festivals, charity shows, political activism, and game-world experiments, heavy music isn\u2019t slowing down \u2014 it\u2019s just mutating.

    "content": "<p>Australian metalcore heavyweights <strong>Parkway Drive</strong> have officially cancelled their ambitious 2026 traveling festival, <a href=\"https://www.parkwavesfestival.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Park Waves</strong></a>, citing overwhelming production and touring costs as the deciding factor. The announcement arrived before tickets went on sale or venues were finalized, abruptly halting what was shaping up to be one of Australia\u2019s most talked-about heavy music events of 2026. More metal news: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/news/\">News hub</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Parkway Drive Canceled Park Waves 2026</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to statements from both <strong>Parkway Drive</strong> and festival promoters, the financial demands behind Park Waves escalated far beyond projections. Production expenses, staffing, staging, transport, and venue costs reportedly surged to the point that the festival became logistically and financially unsustainable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The band emphasized that even established touring acts are struggling under current economic pressures \u2014 a problem impacting the broader 2026 touring landscape. As the metal touring industry faces increased fuel prices, inflated vendor fees, and unstable venue availability, festivals are becoming harder to execute without substantial financial risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DRvzVq3k3is/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

With rotating lineups, unique city-by-city experiences, and a focus on Australian heavy music, <strong>Parkway Drive</strong> positioned Park Waves as a signature event for the region\u2019s metal community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fans had expressed massive excitement online, and early industry buzz indicated strong interest \u2014 making the cancellation even more abrupt and disappointing for the scene.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Impact on Fans and Supporting Bands</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Because no tickets had yet been sold, fans do not need refunds. However, the abrupt nature of the cancellation leaves a gap in the 2026 Australian touring calendar. Bands such as <strong>Northlane</strong> and <strong>Alpha Wolf</strong> face the loss of major festival exposure, which could impact their year-end touring cycles, promotional plans, and album campaigns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For many fans, Park Waves represented a rare opportunity to see Australia\u2019s top heavy bands on the same bill \u2014 a format that is not easily replicated.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What This Means for Heavy-Music Festivals in 2026</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The cancellation of Park Waves highlights a growing concern within the heavy-music industry: even established acts like <strong>Parkway Drive</strong> are not immune to economic instability. Rising production costs, insurance premiums, and supply-chain delays are affecting festivals worldwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Industry analysts warn that 2026 may see more cancellations or scaled-back events if current conditions persist. Fans may also notice shorter lineups, fewer stage productions, or increased ticket pricing as promoters attempt to offset financial risks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">No Replacement Announced \u2014 Yet</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As of now, <strong>Parkway Drive</strong> has not revealed any alternative touring plans or replacement dates for Park Waves. While the band has expressed disappointment, they have made it clear that health and financial sustainability remain a priority.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether Park Waves might return in future years remains uncertain, and the band has encouraged fans to monitor official channels for updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stay locked on <strong>Metal Mantra</strong> for continuing updates on festival developments, touring changes, and <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/festivals/\"><strong>metal festival news</strong></a> across 2026.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Tickets:</strong> <a href=\"https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3DParkway%20Drive%20Cancels\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Get Parkway Drive Cancels tickets on Ticketmaster</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More from Metal Mantra:</strong> <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-metal-tracks-of-2025/\">Top 10 Metal Tracks of 2025</a></p>\n",

    "title": "Six Former Cradle of Filth Members File Lawsuit Against Dani Filth Over Likeness Rights & Unpaid Royalties",
    "content": "<p>After months of public tension, a group of former <strong>Cradle of Filth</strong> members have filed a formal <strong>lawsuit against Dani Filth</strong>, the band\u2019s associated companies and their management. The <strong>Cradle of Filth lawsuit</strong>, lodged in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, alleges unpaid royalties, misappropriation of likeness, copyright infringement and more tied to years of touring, merch and recording activity. More metal news: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/news/\">News hub</a>.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Who Is Suing Cradle of Filth and Dani Filth?</h2>\n<p>According to court filings, <strong>six former Cradle of Filth members</strong> are listed as plaintiffs: keyboardist <strong>Zo\u00eb Marie Federoff</strong>, guitarist <strong>Marek \u201cAshok\u201d \u0160merda</strong>, long-time guitarist <strong>Paul Allender</strong>, guitarist <strong>Richard Shaw</strong>, former keyboardist/vocalist <strong>Lindsay Matheson</strong> (aka Lindsay Schoolcraft) and model <strong>Sasha Baxter</strong> (aka Sasha Massacre), who appeared in the band\u2019s music videos.</p>\n<p>The defendants named in the lawsuit include frontman <strong>Dani Filth</strong> (Daniel Lloyd Davey), <strong>Cradle of Filth LLP</strong>, <strong>Cradle of Filth Touring Limited</strong> and <strong>The Oracle Management</strong>, the company involved with the band\u2019s business affairs.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key Allegations in the Cradle of Filth Lawsuit</h2>\n<p>The lawsuit paints a picture of long-running disputes over money, contracts and control of creative work. Among the major claims, the plaintiffs allege:</p>\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Unauthorized use of likeness:</strong> The band and its business entities allegedly continued to use former members\u2019 images on merchandise, vinyl, posters, online listings and paid meet-and-greet packages after they left the group, without proper permission or compensation.</li>\n<li><strong>Unpaid royalties:</strong> Several plaintiffs claim they are owed royalties for live performances, sound recordings and video appearances tied to their time in Cradle of Filth.</li>\n<li><strong>Copyright infringement:</strong> The complaint accuses the defendants of using copyrighted works, sigils and other designs created by former keyboardist/vocalist Lindsay Matheson without approval.</li>\n<li><strong>Defamation and \u201ctoxic\u201d work environment:</strong> Federoff and \u0160merda allege that statements made about them after they left the band were defamatory and contributed to reputational damage, while also pointing to years of alleged low pay, high stress and unprofessional behaviour from those \u201cabove\u201d them.</li>\n<li><strong>Unjust enrichment and failure to account:</strong> The plaintiffs say they were denied transparent accounting for merch sales, meet-and-greet income and other revenue streams while the band continued to profit from their work and likenesses.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to financial damages, the lawsuit seeks to halt any further commercial use of the plaintiffs\u2019 names, images and performances on Cradle of Filth merchandise or promotional materials.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Background: Departures, Contracts and Growing Tensions</h2>\n<p>The legal action follows a turbulent period for Cradle of Filth. In mid-2025, Zo\u00eb Federoff and Marek \u201cAshok\u201d \u0160merda exited the band mid-tour, publicly criticising what they described as low pay, high stress and \u201ctoxic\u201d internal dynamics. Their social posts and statements included screenshots of contracts they claimed were heavily one-sided and described by their lawyer as among the harshest session agreements they had seen.</p>\n<p>Shortly after their departure, Dani Filth responded with his own statement, disputing their characterisations and defending the band\u2019s business practices. That back-and-forth set the stage for a deeper conflict that has now moved from social media into the courtroom.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Dani Filth and the Band Have Said So Far</h2>\n<p>At the time of writing, official responses from Dani Filth and the defendants have been limited to prior statements addressing the broader dispute. In those comments, Filth has rejected allegations of exploitation and suggested that contracts and internal agreements have been misunderstood or misrepresented.</p>\n<p>The lawsuit, however, escalates the conflict into a high-stakes legal battle, with the former members seeking not only monetary damages but also court orders restricting how Cradle of Filth can use historic imagery, recordings and designs connected to their time in the band.<br />here is the band&#8217;s &amp; dani filth&#8217;s official <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DNv2t18xHfl/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=f9e951d8-3818-4bf9-9bfc-d746e9b26949\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DNv2t18xHfl/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=f9e951d8-3818-4bf9-9bfc-d746e9b26949\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement</a></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why This Lawsuit Matters for Metal and Music Business</h2>\n<p>The <strong>Cradle of Filth lawsuit</strong> taps into larger conversations about how metal and rock bands handle contracts, likeness rights and royalty splits\u2014especially for touring and session players who may not hold equity in the core brand. For many fans, it raises hard questions about how legacy heavy bands operate behind the scenes, and whether long-term contributors are properly compensated when merch and catalog sales continue long after they leave.</p>\n<p>If the plaintiffs prevail, the case could set a notable example around <strong>musician likeness rights</strong>, how older catalog imagery is used on new merch runs, and what obligations established bands have to former members when it comes to royalty accounting and intellectual property.</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Happens Next?</h2>\n<p>The lawsuit against Dani Filth and Cradle of Filth\u2019s business entities is still in its early stages. The court will next work through responses from the defendants, potential motions to dismiss or narrow the claims, and any early settlement talks. Until then, all of the allegations remain just that\u2014<strong>allegations</strong>\u2014and no court has ruled on the merits of the case.</p>\n<p>Metal Mantra will continue to track filings and statements from both sides as the <strong>Cradle of Filth lawsuit</strong> develops.</p>\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">For more breaking updates from across the heavy metal and hard rock world visit our <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/category/news/\">news hub</a></h4>\n",

    "content": "<article class=\"mm-article mm-news-article\"><header>\n\n</header>\n<p>After nearly two decades without a full-length studio album, Swedish heavy metal mainstays <strong>LION&#8217;S SHARE</strong> are finally ready to step back into the spotlight. Their new record, <em>Inferno</em>, arrives <strong>March 27, 2026</strong>, through <strong>Metalville Records</strong>, and marks a major milestone for a band whose influence stretches across the European metal scene and far beyond. More metal news: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/news/\">News hub</a>.</p>\n<p>Fans of traditional heavy metal, melodic power metal, and the classic Swedish steel sound have been waiting a long time for this moment \u2014 and <em>Inferno</em> is shaping up to be the kind of focused, heavy, and revitalized comeback few bands ever achieve.</p>\n<h2>A Return Fueled by Fire, Focus, and Purpose</h2>\n<p>Founding guitarist <strong>Lars Chriss</strong> explains the mindset behind the band\u2019s long-awaited return:</p>\n<p>\u201cFor us, <em>Inferno</em> is more than just a new album \u2014 it\u2019s a statement. We\u2019ve spent years writing, refining, and pushing ourselves harder than ever. The goal was simple: make the strongest, heaviest, and most focused LION&#8217;S SHARE record of our career. I honestly feel we\u2019ve achieved that.\u201d</p>\n<p>Vocalist <strong>Nils Patrik Johansson</strong>, whose unmistakable voice has become one of the band\u2019s defining elements, echoes the sentiment:</p>\n<p>\u201cTaking 17 years between albums wasn\u2019t the plan \u2014 but it gave us time to reset, rebuild, and come back with absolute purpose. We\u2019ve never sounded tighter, and we can\u2019t wait to bring these songs to the stage. This record has everything we love about heavy metal \u2014 attitude, hooks, power. We\u2019re incredibly proud of it.\u201d</p>\n<p>Their words capture the spirit of the new era: not a nostalgic reunion, but a sharpened, battle-ready LION&#8217;S SHARE stepping confidently into the present.</p>\n<h2>A Legacy Rooted in Swedish Heavy Metal History</h2>\n<p>LION&#8217;S SHARE began in <strong>Sundsvall, Sweden</strong>, in 1987 \u2014 a time when Scandinavian metal was evolving rapidly, blending traditional heavy metal with emerging melodic and power metal influences. Guitarist <strong>Lars Chriss</strong> and keyboardist <strong>Kay Backlund</strong> formed the core of what would become one of Sweden\u2019s most respected underground acts.</p>\n<p>The band\u2019s early years were marked by relentless rehearsals, bold songwriting, and a live presence powerful enough to earn them coveted touring spots with some of the biggest names in heavy music:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mot\u00f6rhead</li>\n<li>Saxon</li>\n<li>Dio</li>\n<li>Manowar</li>\n<li>U.D.O.</li>\n<li>Dee Snider</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These weren\u2019t casual opportunities \u2014 they were earned through raw energy, precision musicianship, and a sound that resonated with fans of classic heavy metal around the world.</p>\n<p>Over the years, LION&#8217;S SHARE collaborated with musicians connected to <strong>KISS</strong>, <strong>Megadeth</strong>, <strong>King Diamond</strong>, <strong>Candlemass</strong>, <strong>Symphony X</strong>, and <strong>Yngwie Malmsteen</strong>, further solidifying their status as a respected force in the international metal community.</p>\n<p>Albums like <em>Emotional Coma</em> (2007) and <em>Dark Hours</em> (2009) helped cement their reputation for blending aggressive riffing with melodic hooks, something that carries forward into <em>Inferno</em> with renewed intensity.</p>\n<h2>The New Era: <em>Inferno</em> (2026)</h2>\n<p>Today, LION&#8217;S SHARE operates as a tight, creative partnership between <strong>Chriss</strong> and <strong>Johansson</strong>, supported by trusted musicians in both the studio and on the road. This streamlined approach has allowed the band to refine their sound and focus entirely on songwriting, production quality, and capturing the essence of what makes LION&#8217;S SHARE distinct.</p>\n<p><em>Inferno</em> delivers exactly what its title suggests \u2014 a blazing, intense, and meticulously crafted heavy metal album that reflects decades of experience while still sounding fresh and current.</p>\n<h3>Album Credits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Produced &amp; Mixed by:</strong> Lars Chriss</li>\n<li><strong>Mastered by:</strong> Mike Lind</li>\n<li><strong>All songs written by:</strong> Lars Chriss &amp; Nils Patrik Johansson</li>\n<li><strong>Artwork &amp; Design:</strong> Blekkmark Design Studio</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Studio Lineup</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Nils Patrik Johansson</strong> \u2013 Vocals</li>\n<li><strong>Lars Chriss</strong> \u2013 Guitars</li>\n<li><strong>Andy Loos</strong> \u2013 Bass</li>\n<li><strong>Kay Backlund</strong> \u2013 Keyboards</li>\n<li><strong>Anuviel (Saecred Spirit)</strong> \u2013 Keyboards</li>\n<li><strong>Fredrik Johansson</strong> \u2013 Drums</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Live Lineup 2026</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Nils Patrik Johansson</strong> \u2013 Vocals</li>\n<li><strong>Lars Chriss</strong> \u2013 Guitar</li>\n<li><strong>Andy Loos</strong> \u2013 Bass</li>\n<li><strong>Magnus Ulfstedt</strong> \u2013 Drums</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Discography</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Lion\u2019s Share</em> (1995)</li>\n<li><em>Two</em> (1997)</li>\n<li><em>Fall From Grace</em> (1999)</li>\n<li><em>Entrance</em> (2001)</li>\n<li><em>Emotional Coma</em> (2007)</li>\n<li><em>Dark Hours</em> (2009)</li>\n<li><em>Inferno</em> (2026)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Connect With LION&#8217;S SHARE</h2>\n<p><strong>Official Website:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.lionsshare.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">http://www.lionsshare.org</a></p>\n<p><strong>Bandcamp:</strong> <a href=\"https://lionsshare.bandcamp.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://lionsshare.bandcamp.com</a></p>\n<p><strong>Spotify:</strong> <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/4yIytMmJ2tx30YdMAMkDSo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Listen on Spotify</a></p>\n<p><strong>Facebook:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/lionsshareband\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">http://www.facebook.com/lionsshareband</a></p>\n<p><strong>YouTube:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/lionsshare\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">http://www.youtube.com/lionsshare</a></p>\n<p><strong>Instagram:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lions_share_band/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@lions_share_band</a></p>\n<p><strong>Label:</strong> Metalville Records<br /><strong>Release Date:</strong> March 27, 2026</p>\n</article>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-uagb-image uagb-block-bf99ca20 wp-block-uagb-image--layout-default wp-block-uagb-image--effect-static wp-block-uagb-image--align-none\"><figure class=\"wp-block-uagb-image__figure\"><img decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lions-share-band-1024x575.jpg ,https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lions-share-band.jpg 780w, https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lions-share-band.jpg 360w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 480px) 150px\" src=\"https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lions-share-band-1024x575.jpg\" alt=\"lion's share band\" class=\"uag-image-2481\" width=\"1024\" height=\"575\" title=\"lion's share band\" loading=\"lazy\" role=\"img\"/><figcaption class=\"uagb-image-caption\">L to R: Lars Chriss, Nils Patrik Johansson, Magnus Ulfstedt, Andy Loos</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">For more new metal releases, visit our <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/new-releases/\">New Release</a> section.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Tickets:</strong> <a href=\"https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3DLIONS%20SHARE%20Return%20With%20Inferno\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Get LIONS SHARE Return With Inferno tickets on Ticketmaster</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More from Metal Mantra:</strong> <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/\">Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026</a></p>\n",

    "content": "<article>\n<header>\n</header>\n<p>Former <strong>I Prevail</strong> vocalist <strong>Brian Burkheiser</strong> has officially re-entered the heavy-music world with the launch of his new project,<br /><a href=\"https://scatterbrain.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Scatterbrain</strong></a>, debuting with a dark, dynamic cover of Taylor Swift\u2019s hit single<br /><strong>\u201cLook What You Made Me Do.\u201d</strong> The Scatterbrain Taylor Swift cover marks Burkheiser\u2019s first publicly released<br />music since exiting I Prevail earlier this year and signals the beginning of a new chapter built on reinvention,<br />resilience, and creative freedom. More reviews: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/review/\">Review hub</a>.</p>\n<h2>From I Prevail to Scatterbrain: A New Era for Brian Burkheiser</h2>\n<p>For roughly a decade, Brian Burkheiser helped define <strong>I Prevail</strong>\u2019s sound as the band\u2019s clean vocalist, blending<br />soaring melodies with crushing metalcore arrangements. The band rose quickly from viral fame to festival main stages,<br />earning gold-certified singles and even a Grammy nomination along the way. When I Prevail announced earlier this year that<br />they had \u201cmutually parted ways\u201d with Burkheiser, it closed a major chapter for both the singer and the band.</p>\n<p>After the split, Burkheiser addressed fans directly to clarify that personal and family factors played a role in his<br />departure and that there was no bad blood despite online speculation. What followed was a stretch of relative quiet:<br />teasers, cryptic posts, and hints that he was working on something new under a different name.</p>\n<p>That name is <strong>Scatterbrain</strong> \u2014 a project that allows Burkheiser to step outside the confines of genre and<br />expectation. While I Prevail continues forward with new music and touring plans, Scatterbrain represents a clean slate,<br />and the Taylor Swift cover is the first official statement of intent.</p>\n<h2>Legal Roadblocks, Delays, and the Drive to Create</h2>\n<p>The road to Scatterbrain\u2019s debut hasn\u2019t been simple. In late summer, Burkheiser revealed that an unresolved dispute<br />connected to his former band was preventing him from releasing new original music, including a song titled<br /><em>\u201cPhases.\u201d</em> For fans who had been eagerly waiting to hear what Brian Burkheiser would sound like outside of<br />I Prevail, it was a frustrating development.</p>\n<p>Instead of going silent, Burkheiser decided to pivot. If original material needed to wait, he would find another path<br />to reconnect with listeners. That path became this Scatterbrain Taylor Swift cover \u2014 a way to share something that felt<br />emotionally honest, creatively exciting, and symbolically important without adding more fuel to any legal complications.</p>\n<h2>The Scatterbrain Taylor Swift Cover: \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d Reimagined</h2>\n<p>The new Scatterbrain release reimagines Taylor Swift\u2019s <strong>\u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d</strong> as a tense,<br />cinematic, alt-rock and metal-infused track. Where the original leans into sly pop minimalism and dark swagger,<br />Scatterbrain pushes the song toward a more dramatic, guitar-forward, and emotionally charged space.</p>\n<p>The choice of song isn\u2019t accidental. \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d is a track about reclaiming narrative, shedding past<br />versions of yourself, and standing firm in a new identity \u2014 themes that mirror where Brian Burkheiser is in his career.<br />It\u2019s both a musical statement and a personal one, aligning perfectly with the launch of Scatterbrain.</p>\n<h2>Official Statement: Brian Burkheiser on Scatterbrain and His First Release</h2>\n<p>Alongside the release, Burkheiser shared a heartfelt message to fans as part of the official Scatterbrain press announcement:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>\u201cTo my fans:</strong></p>\n<p>This year forced me to pivot in ways I never expected, and it tested me more than I can explain.<br />But through it all, your support has meant everything.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m excited to finally share a song with you. I chose this cover because it truly resonates with me<br />and serves as a nod to what first sparked my career.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m still working toward the day I can release my original music, but for now, I&#8217;m grateful to have<br />found a way to put a piece of art into the world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The statement underlines just how personal this release is. The Scatterbrain project isn\u2019t a casual side quest; it\u2019s<br />the vehicle for Burkheiser\u2019s creative rebirth, forged during one of the most challenging years of his life.</p>\n<h2>What Scatterbrain Means for Fans of I Prevail and Modern Metal</h2>\n<p>For fans who discovered Brian Burkheiser through I Prevail\u2019s blend of metalcore, post-hardcore, and modern rock,<br />Scatterbrain offers a familiar emotional weight in a new package. Early descriptions of the project emphasize a fusion<br />of rock, hip-hop, pop, electronic elements, and everything in between \u2014 a genre-fluid approach that mirrors how many<br />heavy-music listeners consume music today.</p>\n<p>While I Prevail moves ahead with their own evolution, Scatterbrain allows Burkheiser to explore more experimental,<br />personal, and stylistically diverse material. The Taylor Swift cover feels like a mission statement:<br />he\u2019s not interested in repeating his past \u2014 he\u2019s interested in transforming it.</p>\n<h2>What\u2019s Next for Scatterbrain?</h2>\n<p>The big question now is what comes after this Taylor Swift cover. Fans are still anticipating the official release of<br />original Scatterbrain songs like <em>\u201cPhases,\u201d</em> which were delayed by earlier disputes. Burkheiser has been open<br />about wanting to share that material as soon as he can.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Scatterbrain\u2019s debut sends a clear message: Brian Burkheiser is not quietly slipping away from the<br />scene. He\u2019s stepping back into it with a sharpened focus, a new sound, and a project built entirely on his own terms.<br />Whether the next chapter brings more covers, original singles, or a full album, Scatterbrain is now officially in play<br />\u2014 and the heavy-music world will be watching.</p>\n<p><!-- Internal Link Inserted --></p>\n<p>For more heavy-music updates, visit our <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/category/news/\">Metal &amp; Hard Rock News</a> section.</p>\n</article>\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"SCATTERBRAIN - Look What You Made Me Do (Taylor Swift Cover)\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xogpZVlivH4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n</figure>\n",

North American ticketing is expected to go live next, and fans are encouraged to register early for pre-sale access at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.evanescence.com/evanescence-shows/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.evanescence.com/evanescence-shows/</a></p>\n<p>The band is once again partnering with <strong>PLUS1</strong>, with a portion of ticket proceeds supporting humanitarian and medical relief efforts.</p>\n<h2>What This Means for Evanescence\u2019s Next Era</h2>\n<p>With a major North American return, a massive European arena run, and strong indicators of new music on the horizon, Evanescence\u2019s 2026 world tour marks the beginning of a bold new chapter. It brings together multiple generations of heavy and alternative artists, while placing Evanescence back in the global spotlight in a big, high-production way.</p>\n<p>For full routing, support act

    "content": "\n<p>The past day in heavy music hasn\u2019t delivered many concrete announcements, yet the underground is alive with credible chatter and fast-shifting speculation. This edition of the Metal Mantra Rumor Watch takes a deeper dive into the conversations circulating across fanbases, insider groups, and active scene communities. None of these items are confirmed, but each represents the type of early movement that frequently precedes major developments. As the year closes out, the rumor mill is accelerating, and today\u2019s signals feel louder than usual. Catch more in the <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/\">latest Rundown</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Gojira Album Timeline Sparks Ongoing Speculation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Following <strong>Joe Duplantier</strong>\u2019s hand surgery and the temporary addition of <strong>Greg Kubacki</strong> of Car Bomb for live duties, speculation around the next <strong>Gojira</strong> album cycle has intensified. Fans are openly questioning whether internal schedules have shifted behind the scenes, especially given the band\u2019s reputation for deeply layered, detail-oriented studio work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The band\u2019s continued silence across official channels isn\u2019t helping the uncertainty. Many followers believe the lack of communication signals something brewing rather than nothing happening at all. Whether that points to extended recovery time, additional writing sessions, or a strategic hold remains purely speculative.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Slipknot Fans Expecting a Major Announcement</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Slipknot\u2019s digital footprint has shifted subtly but noticeably, and fans are treating it as smoke before fire. Small changes in member behavior, reduced downtime on socials, and a general uptick in behind-the-scenes activity have sparked theories ranging from lineup confirmations to a new era rollout. Even without official confirmation, the energy around the band feels markedly different from the usual quiet periods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Long-time followers recognize the familiar tension that tends to rise just before the band unveils something significant. Whether that\u2019s new music, a tour reveal, or branding for their next chapter, anticipation is building fast across the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Growing Buzz Around Lorna Shore\u2019s Next Release</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lorna Shore</strong> has entered one of their signature silent phases, which fans historically associate with the lead-up to major announcements. Their unpredictability has only amplified speculation, with conversations ranging from a surprise single to the early stages of a new album cycle. After their explosive recent run of success, the pressure and interest surrounding their next move are higher than ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The band\u2019s fanbase is extremely active even during downtime, and this has created a feedback loop of excitement, theories, and heightened expectations. Until official word breaks, every small change in their digital presence is being scrutinized closely.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Megadeth Farewell Tour Rumored to Expand</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-link-color wp-elements-cacd92963b086960055461fdc3aff033\">With <strong>Megadeth</strong>\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.megadeth.com/blogs/news/megadeth-to-embark-on-canadian-headline-tour-with-anthrax-exodus?srsltid=AfmBOopR009udwndc1z0tkKBMFp6V6r8fAMq4wadNbQSseQ1eZFyxXOM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Canadian farewell tour</a>\u2014supported by <strong>Anthrax</strong> and <strong>Exodus</strong>\u2014already generating massive demand, rumor threads suggest the band may add additional U.S. dates. Several major American markets absent from recent routing have been vocal about wanting a place on the tour, adding to the speculation that the current run may not be the final version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Farewell tours often shift and expand in response to fan demand, and Megadeth\u2019s history of adapting schedules makes the idea even more plausible. Fans are watching for any hint of expansion, especially in areas overdue for a visit.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Amon Amarth European Routing May Grow</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/metal-hard-rock-news-november-24-2025/\">as previously reported,</a> <strong>Amon Amarth</strong>\u2019s 2026 European tour is shaping up to be one of the strongest ticket-moving lineups of the coming year. Early demand has already sparked discussions about extending the run into early 2027, possibly with a refreshed support roster. The band\u2019s reputation for delivering massive, high-production shows has only amplified hopes among fans eager for additional dates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The momentum surrounding the current tour package suggests that expansion is more than just wishful thinking. As pre-sales continue to move quickly across multiple markets, industry watchers are keeping a close eye on regions that traditionally sell out fastest.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Stay Connected</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow <strong>Metal Mantra</strong> daily for confirmed headlines, ongoing rumor tracking, tour developments, release cycles, and evolving stories from across the heavy music world.

    "content": "\n<p>The metal world is buzzing again this week, and today\u2019s <strong>metal news</strong> recap brings major lineup shifts, massive tour reveals, and a wave of heavy new releases across the scene. November has already proven to be one of the busiest months of 2025 for metal and hard rock fans, and this latest round of updates only intensifies the momentum. Catch more in the <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/\">latest Rundown</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Today\u2019s Metal News: Alissa White-Gluz Leaves Arch Enemy After 11 Years</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\ud83c\udfa4 In one of the most talked-about stories in recent <strong>metal news</strong>, Alissa White-Gluz has officially parted ways with <em>Arch Enemy</em> after more than a decade fronting the band. Her powerful vocals and commanding stage presence helped define the band\u2019s modern era, shaping three studio albums, multiple world tours, and a new generation of fans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside her departure, Alissa released a hauntingly cinematic solo single titled <em>\u201cThe Room Where She Died.\u201d</em> The song leans into a darker, more dramatic atmosphere with orchestral layers, clean-vocal passages, and some of her most emotional lyric work to date.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fans immediately questioned whether this marks the start of a full-scale solo era \u2014 and based on the single\u2019s reception, that seems extremely likely. Conversations across social media suggest that many listeners felt the song reflects musical ideas she may not have been able to fully explore within Arch Enemy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Who Will Replace Alissa?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>\ud83d\udce3 As expected, speculation across the <strong>metal news</strong> community is exploding. No official announcement has been made regarding a new vocalist, which has left room for fan theories:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>A return from a former Arch Enemy vocalist</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A surprise choice from another well-known metal band</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A complete newcomer from the underground scene</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Until the band issues a formal statement, the mystery remains one of the biggest open questions in modern melodic death metal.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>HEALTH Release Crushing New Single \u201cSHRED ENVY\u201d</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\ud83c\udfa7 Industrial-metal innovators <strong>HEALTH</strong> have dropped one of their heaviest tracks ever: <em>\u201c<a href=\"https://youtu.be/D3ApCSWCoVU?si=-1pEdpcWJ1qMjyX9\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://youtu.be/D3ApCSWCoVU?si=-1pEdpcWJ1qMjyX9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SHRED ENVY.\u201d</a></em> The song blends the band\u2019s signature electronic distortion, noise-rock aggression, and metallic intensity into a brutal, fully weaponized production that immediately captured attention across the heavy-music world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The track\u2019s official music video dives deep into industrial-horror aesthetics, featuring frantic energy and visual nods to <em>Chainsaw Man.</em> Fans have praised the direction as bold, violent, and refreshingly chaotic \u2014 exactly what HEALTH excels at.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>HEALTH Announce 2026 North American Tour</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside the single, the band confirmed a massive <strong>2026 North American tour</strong>, marking a major cycle for their next era. Early teasers hint at an expanded stage show, upgraded lighting rigs, and the band\u2019s most intense setlist yet. With the success of <em>\u201cSHRED ENVY\u201d</em>, this tour is expected to be one of the standout industrial-metal events of the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Amon Amarth Expand Their 2026 \u201cAllfather Awakens\u201d Tour</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\ud83d\udee1\ufe0f Viking metal giants <strong>Amon Amarth</strong> have added several new dates to their upcoming 2026 UK/EU <strong>\u201cAllfather Awakens\u201d</strong> tour. New stops include London, Manchester, Antwerp, Lyon, and Warsaw. Known for their cinematic storytelling, massive pyro effects, and stadium-sized riffs, Amon Amarth continue their rise as one of Europe\u2019s biggest heavy-music touring acts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their ability to merge melodic death metal with Norse mythology has kept them at the forefront of the scene, and this tour expansion proves just how strong the demand remains across Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Heavy-Music Release Calendar: A Huge Week for Fans</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\ud83d\udcc5 This week\u2019s updated heavy-music release calendar includes dozens of new albums and singles across black metal, metalcore, industrial, and hard rock. Several underground acts are dropping debut EPs, while veteran bands are releasing late-year singles before the 2026 cycle begins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From atmospheric black metal and crushing deathcore to 80s-inspired hard-rock revival tracks, the variety makes this one of November\u2019s most exciting release weeks. Fans looking to stay updated on all new releases can browse our <strong><a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/new-releases/\" data-type=\"page\" data-id=\"2306\">New Releases</a></strong> section</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>The final weeks of 2025 continue to deliver nonstop announcements, new music, and shifts in the heavy-music landscape. Between Alissa\u2019s departure from Arch Enemy, HEALTH\u2019s brutal return, and Amon Amarth\u2019s expanded tour, this cycle has already set the stage for a massive year ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>More Metal News &amp; Hard Rock Updates</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More from Metal Mantra:</strong> <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/\">Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026</a></p>\n",

    "content": "<p>Iron Maiden&#8217;s discography is a towering legacy in heavy metal, spanning <strong>17 studio albums</strong> from their self-titled debut in 1980 to their latest epic in 2021. Over more than four decades, the band evolved from the raw <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_wave_of_British_heavy_metal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">New Wave of British Heavy Metal</a> sound of their early days to the elaborate progressive epics of recent years, selling over <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Maiden\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">100 million records worldwide</a> and influencing countless artists along the way. Every fan has their own opinion on which albums reign supreme. Here, on our fan-driven site, we&#8217;re taking on the challenge of ranking Iron Maiden\u2019s studio albums from worst to best \u2013 a subjective journey through <a href=\"https://ironmaiden.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Iron Maiden</a> history that celebrates the highs, notes the lows, and honors the band&#8217;s unparalleled legacy. More metal news: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/news/\">News hub</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each album contributed something to Iron Maiden\u2019s story, whether it was a lineup change, a bold musical experiment, or a classic that defined a generation. From the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaze_Bayley\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Blaze Bayley</a>-era struggles in the 1990s to the triumphant <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Dickinson\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bruce Dickinson</a>-led reunion albums of the 2000s, from the anthems that fill stadiums on tour to deep cuts beloved by diehards \u2013 they\u2019re all part of the legacy. Strap on your bullet belt and grab your Eddie posters: let&#8217;s dive into Iron Maiden\u2019s catalogue and see how the albums stack up.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">17. Virtual XI (1998)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s no surprise that *Virtual XI* lands at the bottom of our list. The second (and final) Iron Maiden album with vocalist Blaze Bayley, *Virtual XI* suffered from a lack of inspiration and identity. Coming off the lukewarm reception of *The X Factor*, the band attempted to recapture old glory, but the result was widely seen as a misstep. The production is oddly weak and the songwriting feels flat. Even a few decent moments \u2013 \u201cThe Clansman\u201d in particular is a rousing epic that survived in live sets with Bruce back on vocals \u2013 can&#8217;t save the album from its reputation. \u201cThe Angel and the Gambler,\u201d with its endlessly repeated chorus, has become infamous among fans for all the wrong reasons. Every great band has a low point, and for many, *Virtual XI* is it. (If you&#8217;re still curious or completing your collection, *Virtual XI* is available on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+Virtual+XI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Amazon</a>.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">16. The X Factor (1995)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Iron Maiden\u2019s first album without Bruce Dickinson was *The X Factor*, introducing Blaze Bayley as frontman. Blaze had a distinctly different, darker vocal style, and the band\u2019s music followed suit \u2013 *The X Factor* is a sombre, brooding affair. To its credit, the album dared to be different, with longer songs and introspective lyrics reflecting a turbulent time for band leader Steve Harris. \u201cSign of the Cross\u201d is an 11-minute centerpiece that showed Iron Maiden could still write grand epics (Bruce would later sing it live to great effect), and \u201cLord of the Flies\u201d and \u201cMan on the Edge\u201d are solid tracks. However, the overall tone is unrelentingly dark and the energy level never quite reaches the galloping highs Maiden is known for. Many fans appreciate *The X Factor* for its atmosphere, but others find it a difficult listen. It remains a polarizing entry in the discography, and in our ranking it only rises above *Virtual XI*. (Find *The X Factor* on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+X+Factor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Amazon</a> if you&#8217;re looking to explore this chapter of Maiden history.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">15. No Prayer for the Dying (1990)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After an incredible run of classic albums in the 1980s, Iron Maiden hit a bump in the road with *No Prayer for the Dying*. This 1990 release saw a major lineup change \u2013 guitarist Adrian Smith departed, and Janick Gers stepped in. The band also stripped down their sound, aiming for a rawer, more straightforward heavy metal approach after the polished, synth-infused production of the late &#8217;80s. The result was a mixed bag. On the one hand, *No Prayer* gave Maiden their first (and only) UK #1 single with the tongue-in-cheek \u201cBring Your Daughter\u2026 to the Slaughter.\u201d It also features fan-favorite \u201cHoly Smoke\u201d, a cheeky rocker, and a soulful title track \u201cNo Prayer for the Dying.\u201d On the other hand, much of the album felt undercooked compared to what came before. Bruce Dickinson\u2019s vocals were noticeably rougher as he experimented with a raspier style, and the songwriting lacked the epic scope of earlier records. While not without its charms, *No Prayer for the Dying* is often regarded as a downgrade from the brilliance of the 1980s albums. (You can revisit *No Prayer for the Dying* on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+No+Prayer+for+the+Dying\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Amazon</a> and decide if it\u2019s an underrated gem or rightly ranked low.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">14. Fear of the Dark (1992)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Iron Maiden closed out their first Bruce Dickinson era with *Fear of the Dark*, an album that splits opinion among fans. On release in 1992, it received a warm commercial reception (even hitting #1 on the UK charts), but critically it showed signs of creative fatigue. *Fear of the Dark* is notably uneven: it contains some absolute killers along with some filler that drags it down. On the bright side, the iconic title track \u201cFear of the Dark\u201d has become one of Iron Maiden\u2019s greatest live anthems \u2013 its eerie intro and galloping climax drive crowds wild, and it&#8217;s a staple in concert setlists. Other strong cuts include \u201cAfraid to Shoot Strangers\u201d, with its dynamic build-up, and \u201cBe Quick or Be Dead\u201d, a frantic opener that proved Maiden could still thrash with the best of them. However, the album is padded with songs like \u201cWeekend Warrior\u201d and \u201cChains of Misery\u201d that are generally forgotten even by dedicated fans. Following this album, Bruce Dickinson left the band for a few years, making *Fear of the Dark* a poignant end to an era. While it\u2019s far from Maiden\u2019s worst, its inconsistency lands it in the lower half of our list. (If you need *Fear of the Dark* in your collection, it&#8217;s available on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+Fear+of+the+Dark\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Amazon</a>.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">13. Dance of Death (2003)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The early 2000s saw Iron Maiden enjoying a rejuvenation, but *Dance of Death* stands as a somewhat awkward follow-up to the triumphant *Brave New World*. Released in 2003, this album continued Maiden\u2019s foray into longer, progressive-leaning songs, with mixed results. It\u2019s impossible not to mention the cover art \u2013 a bizarre CGI mishmash that many fans consider the worst cover in Maiden\u2019s catalog \u2013 but beneath that, *Dance of Death* has its highlights. \u201cPaschendale,\u201d for instance, is an absolute masterpiece: an epic retelling of a World War I battle, rich with atmosphere and one of Maiden\u2019s best post-2000 songs. The title track \u201cDance of Death\u201d is another standout, a story-driven piece that harks back to the theatrical feel of old classics. There are also fun, shorter tracks like \u201cWildest Dreams\u201d and \u201cRainmaker,\u201d which the band took on tour. However, not every song hits the mark (tracks like \u201cGates of Tomorrow\u201d or \u201cNew Frontier\u201d are often overlooked), and the production feels a bit muddy. Overall, *Dance of Death* ranks mid-to-low in Maiden\u2019s discography \u2013 worthwhile for its high points, but uneven enough to keep it out of the top tier. (Check out *Dance of Death* on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+Dance+of+Death\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Amazon</a> to hear its unique blend of the great and the not-so-great.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">12. The Final Frontier (2010)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On *The Final Frontier*, Iron Maiden took their sound to outer space \u2013 literally and figuratively. This 2010 album has a futuristic theme, kicking off with the experimental intro \u201cSatellite 15&#8230; The Final Frontier\u201d that surprised many fans with its droning bass and echoing drums before exploding into a classic Maiden gallop. *The Final Frontier* is an ambitious effort that earned the band a lot of late-career recognition: it debuted at #1 in 20+ countries and even garnered Iron Maiden their first Grammy Award (for the stomping single \u201cEl Dorado\u201d). Musically, the album continues the band&#8217;s progressive streak, with lengthy tracks like \u201cWhen the Wild Wind Blows\u201d and \u201cIsle of Avalon\u201d showcasing elaborate structures and introspective themes. There are plenty of highlights \u2013 \u201cComing Home\u201d is a heartfelt, nostalgic anthem and \u201cThe Talisman\u201d delivers vintage galloping drama \u2013 yet the album as a whole can feel a bit overlong and dense. Some fans feel *The Final Frontier* could have been trimmed for greater impact, but it\u2019s undeniably a strong record that proved Maiden\u2019s endurance. In our ranking, it sits lower mid-pack, reflecting an album that, while impressive, doesn\u2019t quite reach the heights of the band\u2019s very best work. (Explore *The Final Frontier* on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+Final+Frontier\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Amazon</a> if you want to experience Maiden\u2019s space-bound adventures.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">11. A Matter of Life and Death (2006)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>A Matter of Life and Death</em> is often praised as one of Iron Maiden\u2019s most cohesive and mature albums. Released in 2006, it presents a loosely war-themed collection of songs wrapped in a gritty, almost live-sounding production. Notably, the band was so confident in the material that they performed the entire album on tour \u2014 a bold move that split fan opinions at the time. The album itself is a grower: from the rallying cry of \u201cDifferent World\u201d to the intense build of \u201cThe Longest Day\u201d and the philosophical weight of \u201cFor the Greater Good of God,\u201d every track unfolds with purpose. The songwriting is deep and progressive; tracks like \u201cBrighter Than a Thousand Suns\u201d and \u201cThe Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg\u201d showcase complex structures and dark, heavy riffs that harken back to Maiden\u2019s 80s epics, but with a modern twist. While *A Matter of Life and Death* didn\u2019t produce any radio singles and eschewed any overt \u201chits,\u201d it holds together as an album experience and has earned immense respect from fans who appreciate its depth. Its consistency and ambition earn it a solid spot just outside the top ten in our ranking. (If you\u2019re interested in this powerful chapter of Maiden\u2019s catalog, you can find *A Matter of Life and Death* on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+Matter+of+Life+and+Death\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Amazon</a>.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">10. The Book of Souls (2015)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2015, Iron Maiden proved they still had grand creative ambitions with *The Book of Souls*, their first double studio album. Clocking in at over 90 minutes, *The Book of Souls* is an expansive journey that takes listeners through soaring highs and somber lows. It\u2019s packed with memorable moments: \u201cSpeed of Light\u201d delivers a punchy single with a classic Maiden feel (and a fun retro video game-themed music video to boot), while \u201cTears of a Clown\u201d pays touching tribute to comedian Robin Williams. But the album\u2019s crowning achievement is \u201cEmpire of the Clouds,\u201d an 18-minute epic penned by Bruce Dickinson that tells the tragic tale of the R101 airship disaster with piano, strings, and dramatic storytelling \u2013 arguably Maiden\u2019s most elaborate song ever. Throughout the album, Bruce\u2019s vocals shine (all the more remarkable given he was battling cancer during the recording), and the band sounds inspired. If there\u2019s a downside, some critics felt the length made it a bit unwieldy to digest in one sitting. Nonetheless, the sheer quality of songwriting and the band\u2019s fearless approach to pushing their sound make *The Book of Souls* one of the standout records of their later years. It lands in the middle of our list, which in Iron Maiden\u2019s case means it\u2019s still darn excellent. (Experience the epic scope of *The Book of Souls* on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+Book+of+Souls\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Amazon</a>.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9. Senjutsu (2021)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The most recent studio album, *Senjutsu*, shows Iron Maiden aging like fine wine \u2013 with a dark, cinematic flavor. Released in 2021, *Senjutsu* (Japanese for \u201ctactics\u201d or \u201cstrategy\u201d) finds the band building on the epic formula of their 2000s work. The album cover features Eddie as a samurai warlord, setting the stage for an album full of battle imagery and reflective mood. Musically, *Senjutsu* is bold and patient: songs like the title track \u201cSenjutsu\u201d and \u201cHell on Earth\u201d are expansive and moody, while \u201cThe Writing on the Wall\u201d brings a catchy, almost Southern-rock tinge to Maiden\u2019s sound, and \u201cStratego\u201d delivers a shorter burst of twin-guitar glory reminiscent of their classic days. At this point in their career, Iron Maiden isn\u2019t chasing radio hits \u2013 instead, they\u2019re crafting epic narratives set to music, and *Senjutsu* excelled at that, earning strong reviews and high chart positions worldwide. Some fans rank it among the band\u2019s best work since the \u201980s, whereas others feel it doesn\u2019t quite match the nostalgia of the classics (it\u2019s always tough for new material to compete with decades of legend). In our ranking, *Senjutsu* earns a spot in the upper-mid tier, a testament to Maiden\u2019s continued vitality. After all, not many bands 40+ years in can drop an album of this scope and have it stand proudly alongside their legacy. (You can check out *Senjutsu* on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+Senjutsu&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=metalmantra-20&amp;linkId=cb626a90abc1df0ce5c94556db3c4393&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored\">Amazon</a> to hear Maiden\u2019s latest chapter.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. Killers (1981)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The early Iron Maiden albums have a charm and ferocity all their own, and *Killers*, the band\u2019s sophomore release, remains a fan favorite. This 1981 album was the second (and final) Maiden record with original vocalist Paul Di\u2019Anno, and it marked the debut of guitarist Adrian Smith, solidifying the classic twin-guitar attack with Dave Murray. *Killers* took the raw energy of the debut and tightened it up, thanks in part to producer Martin Birch. The result? A New Wave of British Heavy Metal classic brimming with streetwise attitude and galloping riffs. Just listen to the opening instrumental \u201cThe Ides of March\u201d leading into \u201cWrathchild\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s an adrenaline rush that announces a band on the rise. Other highlights include the sinister \u201cKillers\u201d title track, the melodic \u201cProdigal Son\u201d, and fan-beloved deep cuts like \u201cPurgatory.\u201d Di\u2019Anno\u2019s gritty, punk-tinged vocals give these songs a different edge compared to the Bruce era, and many fans treasure that diversity in Maiden\u2019s catalog. While *Killers* doesn\u2019t have the arena anthems that later albums would deliver, it\u2019s pure, hungry Iron Maiden with a legacy of its own. In our ranking, it sits comfortably in the upper half \u2013 a testament to its enduring appeal for those who love Maiden\u2019s early years. (If *Killers* is missing from your library, you can find it on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+Killers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Amazon</a> and hear the raw power of Maiden 1981.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Iron Maiden (1980)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Where it all began! Iron Maiden\u2019s self-titled debut album from 1980 is more than just a historical artifact \u2013 it\u2019s a raucous, rough-around-the-edges gem that launched one of metal\u2019s greatest careers. *Iron Maiden* introduced the world to the band&#8217;s fast-and-furious musicianship and dark fantasy imagery (all embodied by their mascot Eddie glaring from the cover). With tracks like \u201cProwler,\u201d \u201cSanctuary,\u201d \u201cRunning Free,\u201d and the proggy mini-epic \u201cPhantom of the Opera,\u201d the album showed a young, hungry band fusing the raw power of punk with the technical prowess of metal. Paul Di\u2019Anno\u2019s vocals brought a gritty, street-level vibe that perfectly matched the music\u2019s intensity. Sure, the production is a bit unpolished compared to later albums (the band was unhappy with how the sound turned out, feeling it didn\u2019t fully capture their live energy), but many fans argue that\u2019s part of its charm. *Iron Maiden* made a significant impact in the UK, helping to spearhead the New Wave of British Heavy Metal movement. Decades on, songs from this record still feature in Maiden\u2019s live shows, and the album remains a thrilling listen. Ranking it against the more refined Bruce-era classics is tough \u2013 how do you compare an apple to an orange that breathes fire? \u2013 but we\u2019ve placed the debut at #7, reflecting both its importance and its raw listenability. (Revisit the album *Iron Maiden* on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+Iron+Maiden+1980\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Amazon</a> to feel the birth of the legend.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Brave New World (2000)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A triumphant return. *Brave New World* wasn\u2019t just another Iron Maiden album \u2013 it was a statement that the beast was back. Released in 2000, this record reintroduced Bruce Dickinson as lead vocalist and Adrian Smith on guitar, reuniting the classic six-man lineup (with Janick Gers staying on as a third guitarist). The impact was immediate and electric. *Brave New World* marries the classic Maiden gallop and melody with a fresh, modern production and a renewed sense of grandeur. The opener \u201cThe Wicker Man\u201d is a fist-pumping anthem that announced Maiden\u2019s new era in style (that chorus \u201cYour time will come!\u201d felt very fitting). \u201cBlood Brothers\u201d became an instant fan favorite with its heartfelt tribute vibe and sing-along chorus often dedicated to lost loved ones in concert. The album is rich with epics like \u201cDream of Mirrors,\u201d \u201cGhost of the Navigator,\u201d and the title track \u201cBrave New World,\u201d which showed the band embracing longer, atmospheric intros and elaborate arrangements that would define their 2000s output. Critically and commercially, the album was a success \u2013 proof that Maiden had plenty of fuel left in the tank. Many fans consider *Brave New World* the best Iron Maiden album outside of the 1980s, and it earns a well-deserved place in our top ten. In our ranking, it comes in strong at #6, reflecting its quality and importance in the Maiden legacy. (If you haven\u2019t experienced *Brave New World* lately, grab it on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+Brave+New+World\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Amazon</a> \u2013 it\u2019s a modern classic.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Piece of Mind (1983)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By 1983, Iron Maiden were firing on all cylinders, and *Piece of Mind* captured a band at the height of their &#8217;80s powers. This was the first album with drummer Nicko McBrain, who joined and immediately locked in perfectly with Steve Harris\u2019s galloping bass lines. The result? One of heavy metal\u2019s great albums. *Piece of Mind* is chock-full of classics. \u201cThe Trooper\u201d alone cements the album\u2019s legendary status \u2013 that twin guitar lead and galloping rhythm have come to symbolize Maiden at their gallant best (and it\u2019s accompanied by Eddie waving a tattered Union Jack on stage to this day). \u201cFlight of Icarus,\u201d the album\u2019s big single, gave Maiden their first taste of American radio play with its soaring chorus. Beyond the hits, nearly every track is beloved: \u201cRevelations\u201d showed off Bruce Dickinson\u2019s songwriting and vocal drama, \u201cWhere Eagles Dare\u201d opened the album with blitzkrieg intensity, and deep cuts like \u201cDie With Your Boots On\u201d and \u201cStill Life\u201d are fan favorites. There\u2019s also the admittedly goofy \u201cQuest for Fire,\u201d often playfully mocked for its \u201cdinosaurs and men\u201d lyric \u2013 but hey, a little whimsy doesn\u2019t hurt. Overall, *Piece of Mind* stands as an essential Maiden release that built upon the breakthrough of the previous album and further solidified the band\u2019s global rise. In our ranking, it rounds out the top five. Up the irons! (You can find *Piece of Mind* on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+Piece+of+Mind\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored\">Amazon</a> and experience one of the quintessential 1980s metal albums.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Somewhere in Time (1986)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1986, Iron Maiden took a bold step into the future \u2013 sonically and thematically \u2013 with *Somewhere in Time*. After the exhausting World Slavery Tour, the band embraced some new technology, incorporating guitar synths to broaden their sound. The result was a lush, futuristic album that still roars with classic Maiden energy. *Somewhere in Time* often feels like Maiden\u2019s most \u201c1980s\u201d album (in a good way): it\u2019s big, it\u2019s a bit experimental, and it\u2019s loaded with atmosphere. The hit \u201cWasted Years\u201d remains one of Adrian Smith\u2019s finest songwriting moments, a perfect blend of melancholy and hard rock with an iconic guitar riff and a reflective message about time and home. \u201cStranger in a Strange Land,\u201d with its cool groove and sci-fi Western vibe, became another fan favorite. And for the deep-cut connoisseurs, songs like \u201cSea of Madness\u201d and \u201cAlexander the Great\u201d offer rich rewards \u2013 the latter closing the album with an epic history lesson that fans still campaign to hear live. Although no singles from this album charted as high as previous efforts, *Somewhere in Time* was a commercial success and has grown in stature over the years. It represented Iron Maiden not resting on their laurels and successfully exploring new territory. Many fans hold it as one of their top albums, and in our ranking it claims the #4 spot, just below the absolute cream of the crop. (Relive the space-aged majesty of *Somewhere in Time* via <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+Somewhere+in+Time&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=metalmantra-20&amp;linkId=8c50953e3030323cd6233de993d35397&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored\">Amazon</a> \u2013 it&#8217;s a journey through time every metalhead should take.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Seventh Son of a Seventh Son (1988)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Concept album, anyone? *Seventh Son of a Seventh Son* saw Iron Maiden fully embrace a progressive rock ethos while still delivering all the metal fireworks fans craved. Released in 1988, this was the seventh studio album (aptly), and it built a loose concept around prophecy and mysticism, inspired by folklore about the \u201cseventh son\u201d having supernatural powers. Musically, *Seventh Son* is grand and cohesive. The band reintroduced keyboards/synth (this time via guitar synth and keys) even more than on *Somewhere in Time*, adding rich layers to their sound. The result is an album many consider the pinnacle of Maiden\u2019s creative ambition. Take \u201cThe Evil That Men Do,\u201d \u201cInfinite Dreams,\u201d or \u201cThe Clairvoyant\u201d \u2013 each combines infectious hooks with intricate musicianship and lyrical depth. \u201cCan I Play with Madness\u201d gave Maiden one of their biggest hit singles, a surprisingly catchy and concise song amid the epics. And the title track \u201cSeventh Son of a Seventh Son\u201d is a tour de force: over 9 minutes of theatrical, progressive metal that ebbs and flows brilliantly (complete with a haunting choral section mid-song). The album\u2019s consistency is remarkable; there\u2019s no filler here, just one thematic piece after another. *Seventh Son* was also the last Maiden album of the 80s and marked the end of an era \u2013 after its tour, Adrian Smith left for a time and the band\u2019s sound shifted in the 90s. Critically and popularly, this record often ranks near the very top, and we\u2019re no exception: it claims the #3 spot on our list. Simply put, *Seventh Son of a Seventh Son* is Iron Maiden at their most epic and magisterial. (If you haven&#8217;t immersed yourself in this classic recently, find *Seventh Son of a Seventh Son* on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+Seventh+Son+of+a+Seventh+Son&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=metalmantra-20&amp;linkId=04c8e276ffe3ed8ca0d1e19b48fa3032&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored\">Amazon</a> and enjoy one of heavy metal\u2019s finest hours.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Powerslave (1984)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From the moment you see *Powerslave*\u2019s cover \u2013 the imposing Egyptian-themed Eddie temple \u2013 you know you\u2019re about to witness something monumental. And indeed, Iron Maiden\u2019s 1984 masterpiece *Powerslave* is often heralded as one of the greatest heavy metal albums of all time. This is Iron Maiden at the height of their might. The album explodes out of the gate with \u201cAces High,\u201d a ferocious opener about WWII fighter pilots that became a permanent live staple (often used to kick off concerts with an air raid siren wail). Right on its heels is \u201c2 Minutes to Midnight,\u201d a hard-rocking, politically charged anthem that gave the band a hit single and another concert favorite. The deep cuts on *Powerslave* are just as impressive \u2013 the eerie instrumental \u201cLosfer Words (Big \u2018Orra)\u201d showcases Maiden\u2019s musical tightness, while \u201cFlash of the Blade\u201d and \u201cThe Duellists\u201d offer up galloping riffage and adventurous solos that lesser bands could only dream of writing. The title track \u201cPowerslave\u201d is a thunderous epic that finds Bruce Dickinson belting out mystic lyrics as if casting a spell, all culminating in the album\u2019s grand finale: \u201cRime of the Ancient Mariner.\u201d Clocking around 13 and a half minutes, \u201cRime\u201d adapts Samuel Coleridge\u2019s famous poem into a multi-part metal odyssey \u2013 it was the longest Maiden song for decades and remains a benchmark for prog-leaning metal composition. Beyond the songs themselves, *Powerslave* is significant for the mammoth World Slavery Tour that followed, where Iron Maiden toured the globe with their most elaborate stage show yet (captured on the legendary *Live After Death* album). Many fans and critics point to this era as Maiden\u2019s peak, and it\u2019s easy to hear why. *Powerslave* takes the #2 position on our list, narrowly missing the top spot only because that spot belongs to an album of truly beastly stature&#8230; (If somehow you don\u2019t own *Powerslave*, do yourself a favor and grab it on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Iron+Maiden+Powerslave&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=metalmantra-20&amp;linkId=19ee4583430eb6612831974e38438255&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow sponsored\">Amazon</a> \u2013 this is essential metal history.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. The Number of the Beast (1982)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here it is \u2013 *The Number of the Beast*, the album that transformed Iron Maiden from rising stars into heavy metal legends. This 1982 release was a turning point: it introduced Bruce Dickinson as the new lead vocalist, unveiled some of the band\u2019s most iconic songs, and courted controversy that only boosted its fame. Simply put, *The Number of the Beast* is a cornerstone of metal. The tracklist reads like a greatest hits package: \u201cRun to the Hills\u201d with its galloping rhythm and soaring vocals became Iron Maiden\u2019s breakout hit and a music video staple on early MTV. The title track \u201cThe Number of the Beast\u201d is a dark, theatrical anthem (complete with a spoken word intro from the Book of Revelation) that had conservative groups in the \u201980s branding Maiden as \u201csatanic\u201d \u2013 which, of course, only intrigued kids to crank it louder. And then there\u2019s \u201cHallowed Be Thy Name,\u201d the album\u2019s closing epic, often cited as one of the best heavy metal songs ever written (it\u2019s certainly a crown jewel in Maiden\u2019s catalog, with its dramatic narrative of a condemned man\u2019s last moments and an unforgettable guitar harmony section). But that\u2019s just the big three; the album has no filler, from \u201cInvaders\u201d to \u201cChildren of the Damned\u201d to \u201c22 Acacia Avenue.\u201d The energy, creativity, and confidence bursting out of *The Number of the Beast* are palpable, and it drove the band to new heights \u2013 it was their first album to hit #1 in the UK and put them on the map worldwide. Over 40 years later, it remains the yardstick against which Iron Maiden albums (and indeed many metal albums) are measured. For all these reasons, **The Number of the Beast** claims the #1 spot as Iron Maiden\u2019s ultimate album in our ranking. Up the irons, and long live the Beast!

Few bands can boast such a consistent run of influential albums or inspire such passionate debate among fans about \u201cwhich album is best.\u201d Whether you favor the raw grit of the Di\u2019Anno years, the epic grandeur of the \u201980s Dickinson era, or the dark and adventurous journeys of the modern albums, there\u2019s no doubt every Maiden record has its own magic. This ranking is one fan\u2019s take on a nearly flawless catalog \u2013 even the lower-ranked albums have moments of greatness, and the top-tier records helped define heavy metal itself. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Iron Maiden continues to tour and possibly record new material, their legacy only grows. So cue up your favorite Maiden album (or discover a new one), and let the music take you on a flight through Icarus\u2019s skies, over battlefields and ancient mariner\u2019s seas, to worlds beyond. And remember, <a href=\"/iron-maiden\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Iron Maiden</a> will always *rock in peace*. \\m/</p>\n\n\n<p>Related: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/new-metal-hard-rock-albums-january-9-2026/\">New Metal &amp; Hard Rock Albums \u2014 January 9, 2026</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/\">Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>More Metal Mantra: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/\">Rundowns</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tours/\">Metal Tours</a></p>\n",

    "title": "Welcome to Rockville: North America\u2019s Ultimate Rock & Metal Festival",
    "content": "<p><strong>Welcome to Rockville 2026 stands tall as one of the largest and most electrifying rock and metal festivals on the continent.</strong> Every May, tens of thousands of headbangers, riff-chasers, and devoted heavy-music faithful descend on Daytona Beach, Florida for four days of ear-splitting anthems, career-defining performances, and a culture-heavy festival experience that few events in North America can rival. As part of the modern U.S. festival circuit, Rockville has become a cornerstone event alongside other major gatherings covered in our <a href=\"/category/news/festivals\">Festivals archive</a>. More metal news: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/news/\">News hub</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From its early days as a one-day rock showcase in 2011, Welcome to Rockville has evolved into a full-scale pilgrimage for fans of everything loud, heavy, and uncompromising. Hosted at the iconic <a href=\"https://www.daytonainternationalspeedway.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Daytona International Speedway</a> \u2014 a venue better known for roaring engines than roaring amplifiers \u2014 the festival has carved out a unique identity as the annual centerpiece of the spring rock calendar. Whether you\u2019re chasing circle pits, discovering emerging acts, or watching legacy bands reaffirm their dominance, Rockville delivers an immersive metal ecosystem that resonates long after the final encore fades.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Festival Identity \u2014 A True Metal Community Experience</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome to Rockville isn\u2019t just another large-scale music festival \u2014 it\u2019s a cultural gathering point for the modern rock and metal community. Spread across multiple massive stages over four days, Rockville consistently blends mainstream headliners with underground champions and genre-pushing artists, creating lineups that speak to both lifelong metalheads and newer fans still finding their way into heavy music. That balance has helped Rockville maintain relevance across shifting trends while reinforcing its place in the broader <a href=\"/category/news/metal-news/\">metal news</a> landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From bone-rattling death metal and precision-driven thrash to anthem-ready hard rock, punk-infused hardcore, and metalcore\u2019s most punishing breakdowns, Rockville\u2019s booking philosophy honors the full spectrum of heavy music. This diversity ensures that every attendee \u2014 regardless of subgenre allegiance \u2014 finds their tribe somewhere between the barricade and the beer lines, surrounded by a sea of leather, studs, battle vests, and raised horns.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Daytona Beach? The Destination Festival Factor</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Daytona Beach provides more than a scenic backdrop \u2014 it\u2019s an integral part of Rockville\u2019s DNA. Each year, the Speedway\u2019s sprawling infield transforms into a temporary city of sound, packed with towering stages, vendor corridors, immersive brand activations, and merchandise booths representing nearly every corner of the heavy-music underground. Beyond the gates, the Florida coast adds a destination-level appeal that elevates Rockville beyond a standard festival weekend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether fans are camping inside the Speedway grounds, booking beachfront hotels, or exploring the surrounding nightlife and food scene, Rockville encourages a festival-vacation hybrid that stretches well beyond set times. The result is a shared, multi-day experience where music, location, and community merge into something far more lasting than a single show.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Massive Lineups That Define Eras</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The true backbone of Welcome to Rockville has always been its lineups \u2014 and the 2026 edition raises that standard once again. Celebrating its 15th anniversary, Rockville 2026 will feature more than 160 bands across five stages, with each day anchored by era-defining headliners and a deep undercard stacked with fan-favorite heavy acts. Few festivals manage to balance nostalgia and forward momentum as effectively as Rockville, a trait that keeps it central to annual touring conversations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2026 lineup brings marquee performances from Guns N\u2019 Roses, Foo Fighters, My Chemical Romance, and Bring Me The Horizon, supported by a formidable roster that includes Five Finger Death Punch, Parkway Drive, Motionless in White, Lamb of God, Turnstile, Rise Against, and dozens more. This blend of legacy icons and modern torchbearers turns Rockville into a proving ground where reputations are reinforced and new chapters are written in real time. Full lineup details are available via the festival\u2019s official home at <a href=\"https://welcometorockville.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">welcometorockville.com</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AA1QGo9n.jpg\" alt=\"Welcome to Rockville 2026 lineup poster featuring major rock and metal headliners\" class=\"wp-image-2999\" srcset=\"https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AA1QGo9n.jpg 768w, https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/AA1QGo9n-240x300.jpg 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">More Than Music \u2014 The Rockville Lifestyle</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While the music remains the main event, Welcome to Rockville extends far beyond the stages themselves. Attendees can explore large-scale amusement rides, cool off on water attractions, discover immersive art installations, and take part in curated food and drink experiences designed specifically for a rock-centric crowd. These added layers help transform Rockville into a fully realized environment rather than a simple sequence of performances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Camping options, VIP tiers, and premium hotel packages allow fans to tailor their experience, whether they prefer front-row chaos or a more curated festival pace. That flexibility has made Rockville accessible to first-time festivalgoers while still rewarding long-time veterans who return year after year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Rockville Effect on Touring and Momentum</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Within the broader rock and metal touring ecosystem, a slot at Welcome to Rockville carries real weight. Bands featured on the lineup often experience noticeable momentum shifts, with festival exposure translating into larger tour turnouts and increased visibility across the heavy-music media landscape. For newer acts, Rockville can function as a breakout moment; for established names, it serves as a powerful reaffirmation of live relevance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, Rockville continues to operate as a crossroads where legacy acts and modern contenders intersect, reinforcing the genre\u2019s continuity while pushing it forward. That role makes the festival a reliable barometer for where heavy music stands \u2014 and where it\u2019s headed next.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Welcome to Rockville Still Matters</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In an era where large festival lineups can sometimes feel interchangeable, Welcome to Rockville distinguishes itself by embracing scale without sacrificing identity. Its coastal setting, genre-spanning bookings, and unwavering commitment to heavy music culture make it more than just another stop on the calendar \u2014 it\u2019s an essential rite of passage for rock and metal fans across North America.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you live for breakdowns, fist-pumping choruses, and memories forged in the fire of live amplification, Welcome to Rockville isn\u2019t optional. It\u2019s where the spirit of heavy music comes alive every May \u2014 loud, communal, and unapologetically heavy.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Tickets:</strong> <a href=\"https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3DWelcome%20to%20Rockville\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Get Welcome to Rockville tickets on Ticketmaster</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More Metal Mantra:</strong> <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/slayer-to-celebrate-40-years-of-reign-in-blood-at-rocklahoma-2026/\">SLAYER To Celebrate 40 Years Of Reign In Blood At Rocklahoma 2026</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/louder-than-life-2026-lineup-announced-iron-maiden-tool-pantera-mcr-nearly-200-bands/\">Louder Than Life 2026 Lineup Announced: Iron Maiden, TOOL, Pantera, MCR &#038; Nearly 200 Bands</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/shiprocked-2027-jan-24-30-cruise-announced-after-sold-out-2026/\">ShipRocked 2027: Jan. 24\u201330 Cruise Announced After Sold-Out 2026</a></p>\n",

    "content": "<p><span style=\"font-size: 2.6rem;\">Review: </span><em style=\"font-size: 2.6rem;\">\u201cLeft For Good\u201d</em><span style=\"font-size: 2.6rem;\"> by Bad Omens</span> More reviews: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/review/\">Review hub</a>.</p>\n<article>\n<h2>Introduction: A Dark Return</h2>\n<p>On November 18, 2025, Bad Omens dropped their newest single <strong><em>\u201cLeft For Good\u201d</em></strong> via Sumerian Records, marking the band\u2019s fourth release of the year.</p>\n<p>The song arrives amid high anticipation: frontman Noah Sebastian and the group have hinted at an upcoming album, and \u201cLeft For Good\u201d feels like a bold statement \u2014 a song that sets the tone for the next phase of their evolution.</p>\n<h2>Sound and Production: Atmospheric, Industrial, Emotional</h2>\n<p>\u201cLeft For Good\u201d is arguably one of Bad Omens\u2019 most atmospheric and emotionally charged tracks to date. The production leans into dark, industrial-tinged electronics layered over metallic, heavy undertones \u2014 a combination that feels both cinematic and intensely personal. It opens with a haunting, pulse-like electronic beat that builds tension slowly, drawing the listener into a brooding soundscape before erupting into cathartic breakdowns.</p>\n<p>Instrumentally, there\u2019s a beautiful tension throughout: melancholic melodies meld with gritty guitars, bass and drums underpin a sense of unrest and emotional urgency. Karlsson\u2019s guitar work, Ruffilo\u2019s bass, and Folio\u2019s drumming create a backdrop that seethes with shadowy energy, as the synth layers seep through like ghosts. Over that foundation, Noah Sebastian\u2019s vocal performance glides from ghostly, angelic falsetto to tortured screams \u2014 a dynamic journey that mirrors the song\u2019s emotional depth, giving the track a visceral, cinematic quality.</p>\n<h2>Lyrics &amp; Themes: Inner Turmoil and Breaking Free</h2>\n<p>Lyrically, \u201cLeft For Good\u201d delves into identity, regret, self-discovery, and the heavy decision to walk away from what no longer serves you. The song paints a vivid picture of internal conflict \u2014 a narrator torn between familiarity and the painful necessity to change.</p>\n<p>The chorus \u2014 <em>\u201cWhy do I stay in the middle? Why do I say just a little? Why do I reach from the other side / For all I\u2019ve left for good?\u201d</em> \u2014 captures the tension of being stuck in limbo, unable to fully commit to change even though you know it\u2019s right. Throughout the verses and bridge, the narrator confronts the \u201cmire of truth,\u201d \u201cfolly of youth,\u201d and \u201csmoke in the room\u201d \u2014 metaphors that evoke disorientation, disillusionment, and the toxicity of past mistakes or relationships.</p>\n<p>Yet there is a turning point: as the song reaches its climax, it becomes not just about despair, but about catharsis and autonomy. The raw honesty and demand for closure \u2014 \u201cyou owe me an apology\u201d \u2014 shifts the narrative from pain to empowerment, as the narrator finally chooses to leave \u201cfor good.\u201d</p>\n<h2>Emotional Impact &amp; Significance</h2>\n<p>For long-time fans of Bad Omens, \u201cLeft For Good\u201d demonstrates that the band is pushing themselves beyond past limitations \u2014 musically and thematically. The track doesn\u2019t just lean on heavy riffs or conventional structure; it crafts a moody, immersive experience where atmosphere, emotion, and storytelling are given equal weight.</p>\n<p>As many critics and early listeners note, this isn\u2019t a mere addition to their catalog \u2014 it feels like an emotional anchor for the new era the band is entering. The raw honesty and the willingness to explore pain and growth make the song deeply relatable \u2014 for anyone who\u2019s felt trapped by the past, stuck in indecision, or confronted with the difficult choice to let go.</p>\n<h2>Where \u201cLeft For Good\u201d Stands in Bad Omens\u2019 Evolution</h2>\n<p>\u201cLeft For Good\u201d follows a string of bold 2025 releases from Bad Omens \u2014 including songs that helped them climb charts and expand their sound. But compared to previous singles, this track feels especially intimate, emotionally raw, and sonically ambitious. It signals that the band isn\u2019t content with repeating formulas \u2014 they aim to challenge themselves and the listener.</p>\n<p>As frontman Noah Sebastian and the group gear up for their next album, \u201cLeft For Good\u201d likely represents the emotional heart of that forthcoming work \u2014 a testament to growth, struggle, and rebirth. For many, it will stand out as one of their most powerful and resonant songs.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>In \u201cLeft For Good,\u201d Bad Omens deliver a haunting, cinematic, and emotionally devastating single that marries aggressive instrumentation with deep lyrical honesty. It\u2019s a song about confronting inner demons, acknowledging pain, and choosing self-respect over comfort. For both old fans and newcomers, it offers a compelling entry point \u2014 atmospheric and intense, cathartic and vulnerable.</p>\n<p>As the band moves forward, this song sets a high bar for what\u2019s to come \u2014 a bold sign that Bad Omens is not just evolving, but transforming. \u201cLeft For Good\u201d doesn\u2019t just linger in the mind \u2014 it demands to be felt.</p>\n</article>\n\n\n<div style=\"position: relative; width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;\">\n  <iframe\n    src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jMrNjN0-osw\"\n    title=\"Bad Omens \u2013 Left For Good (Official Video)\"\n    frameborder=\"0\"\n    allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"\n    allowfullscreen\n    style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\"\n  ></iframe>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Related: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/shiprocked-2026-review-metal-cruise-dead-poet-society-knocked-loose/\">ShipRocked 2026 Review</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/testament-para-bellum-album-review/\">Testament \u2013 Para Bellum (Album Review)</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>More Metal Mantra: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/\">Rundowns</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tours/\">Metal Tours</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More from Metal Mantra:</strong> <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/\">Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-metal-tracks-of-2025/\">Top 10 Metal Tracks of 2025</a></p>\n",

    "title": "An Official Static-X Documentary Is Already Underway, Says Estate",
    "content": "<p>As discussions surrounding Wayne Static\u2019s legacy continue to surface within the industrial metal community, representatives of the Static-X estate have confirmed that an <strong>official, estate-approved documentary</strong> is currently in development. Titled <em>Evil Disco \u2013 The Rise, Fall, And Regeneration of Static-X</em>, the film is positioned as the definitive account of the band\u2019s history and the life of its iconic frontman. More metal news: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/news/\">News hub</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The confirmation comes amid renewed interest in Wayne Static\u2019s influence on modern metal and ongoing conversations about how his story should be told. According to the estate, the documentary is in post-production and has been developed with full authorization and cooperation from those closest to Wayne, ensuring that his life and career are presented with accuracy, respect, and proper context.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Evil Disco Aims to Tell the Full Static-X Story</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Evil Disco \u2013 The Rise, Fall, And Regeneration of Static-X</em> is intended to chronicle the complete arc of the band\u2019s journey, beginning with the formation of Static-X in the mid-1990s and their breakthrough during the late 1990s industrial metal boom. The film will explore how Wayne Static\u2019s vision helped shape the band\u2019s signature sound, blending aggressive guitar work, electronic elements, and dance-influenced rhythms into what Wayne famously described as <a href=\"https://static-x.org/blogs/news/evil-disco-the-rise-fall-and-regeneration-of-static-x\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u201cevil disco.\u201d</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The documentary is expected to revisit key moments in Static-X\u2019s rise, including the release of <em>Wisconsin Death Trip</em>, which became a landmark album in the genre and introduced the band to a global audience. Through archival footage and firsthand accounts, the film will examine how Static-X carved out a unique identity during an era dominated by nu-metal and industrial crossover acts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Focus on Legacy, Conflict, and Creativity</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond commercial success, the estate has indicated that the documentary will address the internal conflicts and personal struggles that shaped Wayne Static\u2019s career. These aspects are seen as essential to understanding both the band\u2019s evolution and Wayne\u2019s creative drive, offering viewers a deeper look at the pressures and challenges faced behind the scenes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The film will also examine the band\u2019s eventual dissolution in the early 2010s, the circumstances surrounding Wayne Static\u2019s passing in 2014, and the profound impact his death had on the metal community. Rather than sensationalizing these events, the estate has emphasized that the documentary seeks to present them as part of a broader narrative focused on artistic legacy and human experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Regeneration and the Band\u2019s Modern Era</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A significant portion of the documentary will reportedly focus on Static-X\u2019s rebirth following Wayne Static\u2019s death. The band\u2019s reformation and subsequent releases under the <em>Project Regeneration</em> banner marked a new chapter, allowing fans to hear previously recorded vocal material from Wayne while honoring his influence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The estate-approved film is expected to explore how the remaining members approached this era with caution and respect, balancing the desire to continue performing with the responsibility of preserving Wayne\u2019s legacy. This period has proven pivotal in reintroducing Static-X to a new generation of metal fans while reaffirming the band\u2019s place in industrial metal history.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why the Estate Views This as the Definitive Documentary</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the estate, <em>Evil Disco</em> represents the most complete and accurate portrayal of Wayne Static and Static-X to date. By combining archival materials, interviews with band members, and insights from those who knew Wayne personally, the documentary is designed to serve as an authoritative historical record.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The estate has stressed that maintaining control over how Wayne Static\u2019s story is told is essential to protecting his legacy. As interest in documentaries about influential musicians continues to grow, the film is intended to stand as the official account, reflecting both Wayne\u2019s artistic achievements and the complexities of his life.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Anticipation Builds Ahead of Release</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While a release date has not yet been publicly announced, anticipation surrounding the official Static-X documentary continues to build. Fans have followed updates closely as the band and estate gradually share information about the project\u2019s progress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the industrial metal community reflects on Wayne Static\u2019s enduring influence, <em>Evil Disco \u2013 The Rise, Fall, And Regeneration of Static-X</em> is expected to play a key role in preserving his story for years to come. Additional updates are expected as post-production continues and plans for the documentary\u2019s release are finalized.</p>\n\n\n<p>Related: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/static-x-pushes-back-on-wayne-static-documentary/\">Static-X Estate Pushes Back Against Unauthorized Wayne Static Documentary</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>More Metal Mantra: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/\">Rundowns</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More from Metal Mantra:</strong> <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/sick-new-world/\">Sick New World 2026</a></p>\n",

The band, known for anthems like <strong>Break Stuff</strong> and <strong>Behind Blue Eyes</strong>, returns to Rock for People after 11 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Festival founder Michal Thomes celebrated the momentum:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s great to see the lineup growing before our eyes.

From era-defining headliners to rising heavy acts gaining national attention, Sonic Temple balances familiarity with discovery \u2014 a formula that has kept it culturally significant for nearly two decades.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That balance is especially important in the Midwest, where Sonic Temple functions as both a destination event and a homecoming for regional fans. The festival\u2019s location makes it accessible to fans traveling from multiple states, reinforcing its role as a communal gathering point for the broader rock and metal community.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Columbus, Ohio \u2014 A Purpose-Built Festival Setting</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Columbus provides an ideal backdrop for Sonic Temple\u2019s scale and ambition. Historic Crew Stadium offers expansive grounds, clear sightlines, and a layout designed to handle large crowds without sacrificing the live experience. The venue\u2019s open design allows sound to travel cleanly across stages, giving performances the weight and impact they demand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond the gates, Columbus\u2019 food scene, nightlife, and walkable districts contribute to a festival weekend that feels immersive rather than isolated. Fans don\u2019t just attend Sonic Temple \u2014 they inhabit it for several days, creating a rhythm that blends live music with city culture.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Lineups That Reflect the State of Heavy Music</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As Sonic Temple 2026 approaches, the festival once again positions itself as a defining moment for Midwest heavy music. lineups consistently act as a snapshot of where heavy music stands at any given moment. Headliners often include legacy acts whose catalogs helped define rock radio and festival culture, while the undercard highlights bands actively shaping the genre\u2019s future. That structure allows Sonic Temple to function as both a celebration of history and a forward-facing platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Artists appearing at Sonic Temple frequently use the festival as a launch point for broader touring cycles, with performances signaling momentum shifts and renewed visibility. Full lineup announcements and ticket information can be found via the festival\u2019s official site at <a href=\"https://sonictemplefestival.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sonictemplefestival.com</a>, while ongoing coverage and artist updates live within our <a href=\"/category/news/metal-news/\">metal news</a> section.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignfull size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"819\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/sonic-temple-2026-lineup-poster-819x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Sonic Temple Lineup 2026 Flyer\" class=\"wp-image-3004\" srcset=\"https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/sonic-temple-2026-lineup-poster-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/sonic-temple-2026-lineup-poster-240x300.jpg 240w, https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/sonic-temple-2026-lineup-poster-768x960.jpg 768w, https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/sonic-temple-2026-lineup-poster.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Sonic Temple Experience Beyond the Stages</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Like its peers on the national circuit, Sonic Temple extends beyond music alone. Art installations, curated food vendors, interactive brand activations, and expanded VIP experiences contribute to a festival environment designed to be lived in, not rushed through. These elements help transform Sonic Temple from a concert series into a fully realized cultural event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether attending for a single day or committing to the full weekend, fans experience Sonic Temple as a shared ritual \u2014 one defined by volume, community, and the collective release that only live heavy music can deliver.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Sonic Temple Still Matters</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In a crowded festival landscape, Sonic Temple continues to matter because it understands its role. It doesn\u2019t chase trends blindly or dilute its identity. Instead, it reinforces the core values of rock and metal culture while adapting just enough to remain relevant. For Midwest fans and traveling faithful alike, Sonic Temple remains a reliable annual touchstone for heavy music done right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who value consistency, scale, and a deep respect for the genre\u2019s past and future, Sonic Temple remains an essential stop on the North American festival calendar.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Tickets:</strong> <a href=\"https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3DSonic%20Temple%20The%20Midwests%20Defining%20Rock%20%26%20Metal\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Get Sonic Temple The Midwests Defining Rock &#038; Metal tickets on Ticketmaster</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More Metal Mantra:</strong> <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/slayer-to-celebrate-40-years-of-reign-in-blood-at-rocklahoma-2026/\">SLAYER To Celebrate 40 Years Of Reign In Blood At Rocklahoma 2026</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/louder-than-life-2026-lineup-announced-iron-maiden-tool-pantera-mcr-nearly-200-bands/\">Louder Than Life 2026 Lineup Announced: Iron Maiden, TOOL, Pantera, MCR &#038; Nearly 200 Bands</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/shiprocked-2027-jan-24-30-cruise-announced-after-sold-out-2026/\">ShipRocked 2027: Jan. 24\u201330 Cruise Announced After Sold-Out 2026</a></p>\n",

    "title": "Sick New World Festival Returns as a Major Anchor for Modern Metal",
    "content": "<p><strong>Sick New World has solidified itself as one of the most dynamic and culturally resonant heavy music festivals in North America, uniting generations of heavy fans under a single banner of intensity, nostalgia, and relentless sound.</strong> Emerging in 2023 from the storied Las Vegas Festival Grounds, the festival distinguished itself by showcasing broad swaths of heavy music \u2014 from nu metal and industrial to modern metalcore \u2014 in a way that feels both reverent and forward-looking. In 2026, Sick New World will continue its evolution with two separate one-day events: a spring return to Las Vegas on April 25 and a groundbreaking expansion to Fort Worth, Texas at the Texas Motor Speedway on October 24, marking the festival\u2019s first multi-city footprint. More metal news: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/news/\">News hub</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What set Sick New World apart at its inception was its refusal to conform to rigid genre boundaries. Instead of presenting isolated subgenre blocks, the festival bookers assembled lineups that spanned the heavy music spectrum, inviting fans of legacy acts, alternative metal, industrial titans, and modern heavy innovators to collide in shared enthusiasm. That philosophy has given Sick New World a reputation as a cultural event rather than just another tour stop \u2014 an identity that aligns neatly with our coverage of genre-defining events in the Metal Mantra <a href=\"/category/news/festivals/\">Festivals archive</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Las Vegas edition of Sick New World remains a flagship festival experience. The Las Vegas Festival Grounds, a space that has hosted some of the most talked-about rock and metal events in recent years, provides an expansive canvas for the festival\u2019s vision. The city\u2019s destination energy, travel accessibility, and late-night culture make the experience feel larger than a single lineup \u2014 it feels like a pilgrimage. On April 25, 2026, Las Vegas will once again break open with a stacked roster of influential performers that reflect the festival\u2019s eclectic DNA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the story of Sick New World\u2019s growth in 2026 is just as much about geography as it is about evolution. For the first time, the festival will take its ethos to the Lone Star State, setting up a one-day event at the Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth on October 24, 2026. This expansion is significant not just because it brings Sick New World into a new region, but because Texas has a deep and enduring connection to rock and metal culture that continues to shape touring and festival circuits across the U.S. The Texas edition promises a lineup befitting the state\u2019s storied rock legacy, offering both legendary names and contemporary heavy favorites.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Twin Experiences, Shared Intensity</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What unites the Las Vegas and Texas Sick New World events is a shared commitment to high-impact programming. Rather than diluting the brand into sprawling multi-day formats, Sick New World has doubled down on delivering concentrated one-day experiences that throw a spotlight on heavy music\u2019s emotional resonance and communal power. Each event feels like a festival condensed to its most potent elements: nonstop stages, monumental performances, and a crowd that understands the significance of experiencing heavy music live together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This approach resonates strongly in a festival landscape where brevity and intensity can be just as memorable as multi-weekend affairs, especially when paired with headliners that bridge eras. The presence of System of a Down, among other seminal acts, serves as a connective tissue between old and new generations of fans \u2014 a thematic current that runs through the culture of heavy music and one that fans frequently explore within our <a href=\"/category/news/metal-news/\">metal news</a> coverage.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Cultural Anchor in Modern Metal</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By expanding into Texas while maintaining its Las Vegas roots, Sick New World has positioned itself not just as a festival but as a cultural anchor for modern heavy music. The festival\u2019s trajectory mirrors the evolving demands of fans who crave both nostalgia and discovery, community and individuality. Whether it\u2019s thousands gathering under the neon skies of Vegas or the wide open grounds of Fort Worth, the energy is unmistakably communal, cathartic, and loud \u2014 the very essence of the heavy experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sick New World in 2026 is more than a return; it\u2019s a reaffirmation of heavy music\u2019s vitality in the live music ecosystem, and its dual-location strategy underscores that significance. For fans who live for breakdowns, blast beats, roaring riffs, and the shared electricity of peak festival experiences, Sick New World remains one of the most compelling events on the North American calendar.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"820\" height=\"1024\" data-id=\"2992\" src=\"https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/68fa58adc230b5b2ff078ddc_SNW_VEGAS-2-820x1024.png\" alt=\"Sick New World 2026 Las Vegas Lineup Flyer\" class=\"wp-image-2992\" srcset=\"https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/68fa58adc230b5b2ff078ddc_SNW_VEGAS-2-820x1024.png 820w, https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/68fa58adc230b5b2ff078ddc_SNW_VEGAS-2-240x300.png 240w, https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/68fa58adc230b5b2ff078ddc_SNW_VEGAS-2-768x959.png 768w, https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/68fa58adc230b5b2ff078ddc_SNW_VEGAS-2-1230x1536.png 1230w, https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/68fa58adc230b5b2ff078ddc_SNW_VEGAS-2.png 1400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 820px) 100vw, 820px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"820\" height=\"1024\" data-id=\"2991\" src=\"https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/68fb843054a8dd3007d485a3_SNW_TX-3-820x1024.png\" alt=\"Sick New World 2026 Texas Lineup Flyer\" class=\"wp-image-2991\" srcset=\"https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/68fb843054a8dd3007d485a3_SNW_TX-3-820x1024.png 820w, https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/68fb843054a8dd3007d485a3_SNW_TX-3-240x300.png 240w, https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/68fb843054a8dd3007d485a3_SNW_TX-3-768x959.png 768w, https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/68fb843054a8dd3007d485a3_SNW_TX-3-1229x1536.png 1229w, https://metal-mantra.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/68fb843054a8dd3007d485a3_SNW_TX-3.png 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 820px) 100vw, 820px\" /></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n<p><strong>Tickets:</strong> <a href=\"https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3DSick%20New%20World\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Get Sick New World tickets on Ticketmaster</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More Metal Mantra:</strong> <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/slayer-to-celebrate-40-years-of-reign-in-blood-at-rocklahoma-2026/\">SLAYER To Celebrate 40 Years Of Reign In Blood At Rocklahoma 2026</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/louder-than-life-2026-lineup-announced-iron-maiden-tool-pantera-mcr-nearly-200-bands/\">Louder Than Life 2026 Lineup Announced: Iron Maiden, TOOL, Pantera, MCR &#038; Nearly 200 Bands</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/shiprocked-2027-jan-24-30-cruise-announced-after-sold-out-2026/\">ShipRocked 2027: Jan. 24\u201330 Cruise Announced After Sold-Out 2026</a></p>\n",

    "title": "Sleep Token Conjures An Arcadian Ritual At Oakland Arena",
    "content": "<p>On October 10, 2025, <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tag/sleep-token/\" target=\"_self\">Sleep Token</a> turned the Oakland Arena into a temple of atmospheric metal. From the moment the lights dimmed and the crowd\u2019s roar subsided into anticipatory silence, it was clear this would not be an ordinary concert\u2014it was a ritual. Fans donned Sleep Token masks and merch, arriving hours early, buzzing with reverence for the UK band\u2019s first-ever arena headliner in the Bay Area. More reviews: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/review/\">Review hub</a>.</p>\n<p>The evening began with a potent opening set by Australian alt-metal outfit Thornhill, whose crushing riffs and melodic choruses primed the audience and built the tension to a fever pitch. By the time Sleep Token\u2019s symbol flickered on the screen and the headliners emerged, the atmosphere was electric. What unfolded next was a transcendent journey through lush soundscapes and crushing heaviness, delivered with the mysterious flair that has become the band\u2019s hallmark.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\"/>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Musical Performance &amp; Setlist Highlights</h2>\n<p>Sleep Token\u2019s setlist was an odyssey through the band\u2019s catalog, heavily showcasing their latest album <em>Even in Arcadia</em>. The show opened with the haunting intro of \u201cLook to Windward,\u201d as frontman Vessel\u2019s ethereal voice intoned \u201cWill you listen?\u201d into the dark. At the song\u2019s seismic drop, a massive curtain fell, revealing the masked quartet perched within an elaborate multi-tiered stage set. From there, the band launched into fan favorites like \u201cThe Offering\u201d and \u201cVore,\u201d seamlessly shifting between delicate piano passages and downtuned guitar onslaughts.</p>\n<p>Anchored by the ferocious drumming of band member II, the musicianship was airtight. Complex polyrhythms and dynamic shifts in songs such as \u201cCaramel\u201d and \u201cThread the Needle\u201d were executed live with near-album precision. \u201cThe Summoning\u201d featured a blistering drum solo that drew raucous cheers under an onslaught of strobes, while nearly the entirety of <em>Even in Arcadia</em> was woven together with material from <em>Take Me Back to Eden</em> and earlier releases. By the time \u201cInfinite Baths\u201d closed the set, the arena had been completely spellbound.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\"/>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Stage Production &amp; Lighting Spectacle</h2>\n<p>If Sleep Token\u2019s music is a journey, their stage production provided the immersive world it inhabits. The Oakland Arena stage became a massive Arcadian castle\u2014rocky, grotto-like, and layered with towering archways. At its center, the band\u2019s glowing rune symbol served as a waterfall backdrop, with real water cascading down and catching the light. As the opening curtain dropped, the audience was pulled directly into the <em>Even in Arcadia</em> mythos.</p>\n<p>Lighting was a spectacle of its own. Lasers and spotlights painted the air in vivid colors synchronized to each song\u2019s emotional arc. \u201cAlkaline\u201d cut the darkness with piercing blue beams, while \u201cDamocles\u201d transformed the arena into a field of stars as fans raised colored lights in unison. Fog, falling petals, and blinding strobes were all deployed with precision, never overpowering the music but amplifying its emotional weight.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\"/>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Audience Energy &amp; Interaction</h2>\n<p>The Oakland Arena crowd was as much a part of the ritual as the band itself. Nearly 20,000 worshippers fell into reverent silence during the show\u2019s opening moments, only to erupt in waves of movement and sound as the set unfolded. Tender passages like \u201cRain\u201d were met with communal swaying and hushed sing-alongs, while the breakdowns of \u201cThe Summoning\u201d detonated the floor into synchronized chaos.</p>\n<p>Despite maintaining complete onstage silence, Vessel and the band communicated volumes through movement alone. Gestures, posture, and presence created an unspoken dialogue with the audience. Fans traded friendship bracelets, shared space, and moved as one\u2014a reminder that Sleep Token\u2019s following is not just a fanbase, but a bonded community. The <em>Sleep Token Oakland 2025</em> performance felt less like a concert and more like a collective ritual.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\"/>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Venue Atmosphere &amp; Acoustics</h2>\n<p>Oakland Arena can be unforgiving acoustically, yet Sleep Token\u2019s production team delivered a mix that was both massive and immaculate. Bass lines rattled the floor during \u201cVore\u201d and \u201cGranite,\u201d while Vessel\u2019s vocals floated clearly above the chaos. The venue shifted effortlessly between cathedral-like silence and overwhelming sonic force, a testament to the band\u2019s command of space and dynamics.</p>\n<p>Few arena shows manage to feel intimate without losing scale. Sleep Token achieved both, holding the audience in a shared moment that felt personal and monumental all at once.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\"/>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Standout Moments</h2>\n<p>The most jaw-dropping moment came during \u201cProvider,\u201d when a saxophonist emerged without warning to perform the song\u2019s sultry melodic line live\u2014marking the first time Sleep Token incorporated saxophone into their set. The unexpected fusion of smooth jazz tones with crushing metal sent the crowd into disbelief.</p>\n<p>Later, \u201cThe Summoning\u201d triggered a full-arena eruption as thousands moved in unison, while \u201cDamocles\u201d bathed the venue in orange and purple light through a coordinated fan effort.

    "title": "Testament \u2013 Para Bellum (Album Review)",
    "content": "<p>Even before the music starts, the hand-painted cover art of <em>Para Bellum</em> \u2014 depicting a serene angel constructed from missiles amid an apocalyptic backdrop \u2014 signals that Testament\u2019s fourteenth studio album is not a nostalgia exercise. As Bay Area thrash veterans with over four decades behind them, <a href=\"/tag/testament\">Testament</a> carry a legacy most bands could only dream of, yet they sound as ferocious, focused, and genuinely hungry as they ever have. <em>Para Bellum</em> \u2014 Latin for \u201cprepare for war\u201d \u2014 reflects a band that has no interest in softening with age. Instead, Testament deliver an album that pushes modern thrash forward with sharpened aggression, calculated darkness, and a disciplined sense of purpose. The result is a record that stands tall within their modern era and feels essential rather than ceremonial. More reviews: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/review/\">Review hub</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Balanced Onslaught of Speed and Substance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From the opening seconds of \u201cFor the Love of Pain,\u201d <em>Para Bellum</em> explodes with immediate intent. New drummer Chris Dovas wastes no time announcing himself, attacking the kit with relentless precision and raw physicality. Replacing a figure as iconic as Gene Hoglan is no small task, but Dovas doesn\u2019t attempt imitation \u2014 he injects youthful violence and urgency that propels Testament into heavier, more extreme territory. The track itself is a whirlwind of serrated riffing, muscular grooves, and subtle blackened textures that nod to Eric Peterson\u2019s extreme metal instincts. It\u2019s an invigorating opener that makes one thing clear: this band is not here to replay the hits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lead single \u201cInfanticide A.I.\u201d follows as a high-velocity juggernaut, pairing blistering thrash speed with a venomous critique of technological overreach. Chuck Billy sounds commanding and dangerous, shifting seamlessly between classic thrash bark, guttural snarls, and eerie vocal inflections that give the song real narrative weight. Guitarists Eric Peterson and Alex Skolnick are locked in, unleashing riffs that feel both brutal and purposeful. Skolnick\u2019s soloing here is particularly striking \u2014 fluid, sharp, and perfectly integrated into the song\u2019s momentum rather than existing as technical exhibition. When the mid-tempo menace of \u201cShadow People\u201d emerges, its ominous groove and dark undercurrents reinforce the sense that <em>Para Bellum</em> is expanding Testament\u2019s sound without ever abandoning its thrash foundation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite its aggression, <em>Para Bellum</em> avoids becoming a one-dimensional barrage. Midway through the record, Testament introduce greater melodic range and dynamic contrast without losing intensity. \u201cMeant to Be\u201d stands as the album\u2019s boldest left turn \u2014 a seven-and-a-half-minute epic that layers orchestral elements, clean guitar passages, and crushing heaviness into a slow-burning emotional centerpiece. Rather than feeling forced or sentimental, the track comes across as mature and earned. Chuck Billy delivers one of his most nuanced performances here, while Skolnick\u2019s soaring solo injects genuine feeling into the arrangement. It\u2019s an ambitious moment that deepens the album and proves Testament are still willing to challenge themselves creatively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once that tension breaks, the band returns to full-throttle assault. \u201cHigh Noon\u201d injects a swaggering groove laced with playful menace, while \u201cWitch Hunt\u201d and \u201cNature of the Beast\u201d channel classic heavy metal melody through a modern thrash lens. Deeper cuts like \u201cRoom 117\u201d and \u201cHavana Syndrome\u201d showcase Testament\u2019s continued ability to evolve within their framework \u2014 the former locking into a thick, hook-driven mid-tempo stomp, the latter weaving galloping rhythms and harmonized leads into a crushing attack. The closing title track, \u201cPara Bellum,\u201d serves as a fitting finale: expansive, punishing, and layered with atmosphere, technical precision, and pure intent.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Standout Tracks</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n  <li><strong>\u201cInfanticide A.I.\u201d</strong> \u2014 A blistering, high-speed standout that captures Testament at their most vicious. Modern thrash riffing, scathing themes, and surgical musicianship collide in one of the band\u2019s fiercest tracks to date.</li>\n  <li><strong>\u201cMeant to Be\u201d</strong> \u2014 A daring, emotionally driven centerpiece that expands Testament\u2019s sonic palette. Orchestration, atmosphere, and heavy dynamics combine into a track that feels monumental rather than indulgent.</li>\n  <li><strong>\u201cHavana Syndrome\u201d</strong> \u2014 Galloping riffs and melodic twin-guitar leads give this song a classic-metal undercurrent while maintaining a relentless thrash backbone. It\u2019s one of the album\u2019s most memorable late-stage punches.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Performance and Production</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Performance-wise, <em>Para Bellum</em> captures Testament operating at peak efficiency. Chuck Billy remains one of thrash metal\u2019s most authoritative frontmen, delivering vocals that balance brutality with control. Eric Peterson\u2019s rhythm guitar work is dense and deliberate, providing the album\u2019s unshakable foundation, while Alex Skolnick\u2019s leads cut through with precision and personality. Steve Di Giorgio\u2019s bass lines add depth and movement beneath the guitar onslaught, and Chris Dovas proves himself a formidable new force behind the kit, injecting speed, violence, and momentum throughout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The production is equally formidable. Mixed by Jens Bogren, the album sounds massive without sacrificing clarity. Every instrument occupies its space, allowing the record\u2019s density to feel powerful rather than cluttered. The guitars hit with weight, the drums punch with authority, and the atmospheric elements are woven in seamlessly. <em>Para Bellum</em> sounds modern, sharp, and uncompromising \u2014 exactly how a Testament record should sound in 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Legacy Secure \u2013 Testament\u2019s War Cry</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At a time when many veteran bands rely on legacy alone, Testament continue to raise the bar. <em>Para Bellum</em> proves that thrash metal\u2019s old guard can still outpace, outthink, and outplay much of the genre\u2019s younger wave. This is not a band coasting \u2014 it\u2019s a band sharpening its edge. There are moments of risk and stylistic expansion, but nothing feels half-hearted or stale. If anything, those risks give the album its identity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, <em>Para Bellum</em> stands as one of Testament\u2019s strongest modern releases \u2014 a focused, aggressive, and deeply confident record that reinforces their relevance rather than merely celebrating their past. Fourteen albums in, Testament still sound dangerous, still sound motivated, and still sound like leaders. <em>Para Bellum</em> is available now via Nuclear Blast Records \u2014 you can grab it on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FN8DKMQ3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon</a> \u2014 and it serves as a clear reminder that Testament have no intention of surrendering their throne.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Listen/Buy:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Testament+++Para+Bellum+%28Album&#038;tag=metalmantra-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Find on Amazon</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Related: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/thrash-of-the-titans-usa-tour-2026/\">Thrash of the Titans USA Tour 2026: Testament, Overkill &#038; Destruction Unite for an Epic Thrash Metal Assault</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>More Metal Mantra: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/\">Rundowns</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tours/\">Metal Tours</a></p>\n",

Four days of heavy music, mosh pits, mud, and metal in Sacramento.\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>\n    The 13th annual Aftershock Festival detonated at Discovery Park in Sacramento from October 2\u20135, 2025 \u2014 and it didn\u2019t just rise up. It exploded. Over four days, more than 164,000 fans descended from across the country and around the world to witness what many are already calling the biggest Aftershock yet. It wasn\u2019t just a concert series \u2014 it was a four-day collision of chaos, sweat, nostalgia, and unfiltered musical violence.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n    What followed was four days of sonic brutality and four nights of cathartic release: a celebration of rock, punk, and metal, where nostalgia and rebellion locked arms. This is the Aftershock Festival 2025 review through Metal Mantra\u2019s eyes \u2014 messy, loud, and absolutely alive.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Day One \u2014 Pop-Punk Shock &amp; Metal\u2019s Back Alleys</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\n    Thursday\u2019s opening salvo leaned hard into pop-punk nostalgia while quietly loading the side stages with serious heaviness. The main-stage Aftershock 2025 lineup for Day One read like a warped early-2000s mixtape: <strong>Blink-182</strong> reigning as headliners, flanked by <strong>Good Charlotte</strong>, <strong>All Time Low</strong>, <strong>Taking Back Sunday</strong>, and <strong>The All-American Rejects</strong>. It was a full-frontal assault of hooks, harmonies, and heartbreak lyrics yelled back by thousands of fans who grew up on warped-tour summers and burned CD-Rs.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n    Blink-182\u2019s headlining set felt like a time capsule smashed open and reassembled at maximum volume. Anthems like \u201cAll the Small Things,\u201d \u201cFeeling This,\u201d and \u201cWhat\u2019s My Age Again?\u201d hit with familiar impact, while newer material proved the band has more in the tank than just nostalgia. Between off-color jokes and crowd-wide singalongs, the headliners turned Discovery Park into a communal therapy session for aging punks and wide-eyed newcomers alike.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n    But this is Aftershock \u2014 pop-punk was only half the story. Dive off the main drag and the festival\u2019s metal DNA was very much alive in the shadows. Side stages churned with heavier acts: <strong>Carcass</strong> ripped through surgical death-metal riffs; <strong>Cattle Decapitation</strong> delivered a suffocating wall of grind and death; <strong>High on Fire</strong> smoked the air with thick, doom-soaked guitar tone; and <strong>Nails</strong> detonated short, vicious bursts of hardcore violence. For fans tracking the heavier end of the Aftershock 2025 lineup, Day One was already a win.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n    Hardcore and crossover fans got theirs too. Bands like <strong>Hatebreed</strong> turned circles of mud into tidal-wave pits, barking along to breakdown-ready anthems and turning the festival grounds into a training ground for the rest of the weekend. It was the perfect balance: main-stage pop-punk melodies on one side, underground chaos on the other. The message was clear \u2014 Aftershock 2025 wasn\u2019t just for one subgenre tribe. It was for all of them.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n    Rain rolled in early and turned the park into a sloppy battlefield, but nobody flinched. Ponchos, trash bags, soaked hoodies and smeared eyeliner became part of the uniform. Fans trudged through ankle-deep muck to make it to the barricade, to catch that next chorus, that next breakdown. The weather tried to drown Day One; the crowd simply roared back louder.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Day Two \u2014 Homecoming, Bay-Area Thrash &amp; Metal Legacy</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\n    Friday dialed down the sugar and turned up the weight. If Day One was a grin, Day Two was a clenched jaw. At the center of it all were Sacramento\u2019s own <strong>Deftones</strong>, turning Aftershock 2025 into a full-on hometown ritual. From the moment they hit the stage, the air changed \u2014 thick with anticipation, history, and the kind of love only a hometown crowd can radiate.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n    Deftones built a career-spanning set, gliding from the dreamlike haze of \u201cDigital Bath\u201d to the feral stomp of \u201cMy Own Summer (Shove It)\u201d and the crushing weight of \u201cDiamond Eyes.\u201d When epic cuts washed over the crowd, you could feel thousands of voices rising in unison \u2014 a generation that grew older but never outgrew the band. This wasn\u2019t just a headline set; it was a community exhale, a shared moment between a band and the city that raised them.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n    The rest of the Day Two Aftershock 2025 lineup kept things dynamic and dangerous. <strong>A Perfect Circle</strong> delivered sleek, surgical alt-rock on the main stage \u2014 an exercise in tension, melody, and restraint amid the festival chaos. <strong>Turnstile</strong> lit up the crowd with their hyperactive, groove-soaked hardcore, turning the pit into a trampoline of bodies and sweaty grins. <strong>Knocked Loose</strong> barreled through one of the most violent sets of the weekend, conjuring breakdowns that hit like steel-toed boots to the chest.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n    But Friday had more than just groove and hardcore \u2014 it dug deep into thrash and Bay Area metal roots too. Old-school fans got their fix with legendary Bay Area thrash icons like <strong>Death Angel</strong> and <strong>Exodus</strong> tearing up the undercard stages. Their presence added a gritty nod to the region\u2019s metal legacy, reminding everyone that Aftershock isn\u2019t just about flash \u2014 it\u2019s about roots, thrash history, and heavy metal\u2019s long memory.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n    Metal traditionalists and prog-heads got their fix too. <strong>Lamb of God</strong> unleashed a textbook lesson in groove-metal, all whiplash riffs and razor-sharp precision, while <strong>Dream Theater</strong> bent time, tempo, and minds with labyrinthine prog epics. In between, you could catch everything from sludgy post-metal to classic-thrash revival, as bands rotated through stages like a living museum of heavy music\u2019s evolution.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n    By the time the lights went down on Day Two, one thing was obvious: Aftershock 2025 wasn\u2019t coasting on big names alone. It was curating moods. Deftones may have been the emotional anchor \u2014 the headliners who turned the park into a cathedral \u2014 but every band that touched Friday\u2019s stages helped write the next chapter of the festival\u2019s legacy.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Day Three \u2014 Nu-Metal Bullets &amp; Underground Fury</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\n    Saturday was built for chaos. If you came to Aftershock 2025 for nu-metal, this was your day to bleed. <strong>Korn</strong> took command of the main stage with a set that felt like a livewire plugged straight into 1999 and dragged screaming into the present. From the first lurching bassline of \u201cBlind\u201d to the twisted bounce of \u201cFreak on a Leash,\u201d the band delivered a reminder of why they\u2019re still at the top of the nu-metal food chain.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n    Jonathan Davis stalked the stage like a man possessed, his vocals shifting from guttural growls to desperate wails, while the band\u2019s downtuned crunch turned the lawn into a heaving ocean of bodies. Old-school fans got their nostalgia overload; newer converts got baptized by dust, sweat, and riff. For many, this was the high point of the entire Aftershock Festival 2025 \u2014 the moment where anticipation, nostalgia, and live energy collided at full speed.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n    Korn didn\u2019t carry Saturday alone. <strong>Gojira</strong> shook the earth with their titanic, eco-apocalyptic groove metal, each riff landing like an artillery shell. <strong>Chevelle</strong> kept the alt-metal torch burning with tight, melodic heaviness. <strong>Bad Omens</strong> brought a modern, sleek, almost cinematic edge to the lineup, pulling in younger fans and proving that contemporary metalcore belongs on big festival stages.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n    Away from the marquee names, Saturday\u2019s undercard was a gauntlet. Deathcore units roared through sub-harmonic breakdowns; blackened thrash outfits spat out high-speed venom; hardcore bands turned smaller pits into boiling cauldrons of stagedives and pile-ons. Fans bounced between stages chasing the next riff, the next scream, the next chance to throw themselves into the fray.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n    By the end of Day Three, everyone was running on fumes and adrenaline. Voices were shot, necks were wrecked, and shoes were barely hanging together, but nobody slowed down. If Aftershock 2025 had a single word to define Saturday, it was simple: <strong>relentless</strong>.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Day Four \u2014 Apocalypse, Mayhem &amp; Triumphant Closure</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\n    Sunday arrived with that weird mix of exhaustion and \u201cone more day\u201d desperation \u2014 and Aftershock 2025 answered with one of its most adventurous headliners. <strong>Bring Me The Horizon</strong> closed out the festival with a set that felt like a hybrid of metalcore, arena rock, and dystopian rave. Lasers cut through the night, massive choruses crashed over the crowd, and thousands of voices chanted every hook like a cult hymn.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n    From older cuts to newer, genre-bending tracks, BMTH treated the Aftershock 2025 lineup like a playground. \u201cShadow Moses,\u201d \u201cThrone,\u201d and other fan-favorites detonated across the park, while newer, more experimental material showcased the band\u2019s evolution into one of modern heavy music\u2019s most divisive \u2014 and undeniable \u2014 forces. It was theatrical, bombastic, and unapologetically over the top, the exact kind of spectacle a four-day festival closer should be.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n    The rest of Day Four kept the needle buried in the red. <strong>Rob Zombie</strong> rolled in with horror-metal theatrics, zombie-flick visuals and carnival-of-the-damned energy. <strong>Marilyn Manson</strong> surfaced with a bruised, grimy industrial stomp that felt like a ghost of shock rock\u2019s past grinding against the present. <strong>Mudvayne</strong> brought mathy, groove-loaded chaos, while <strong>Machine Head</strong> carved through tightly wound thrash and groove-metal epics that had the diehards losing their minds one last time.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n    As Sunday night wore on, there was this sense of collective burnout and triumph. Fans slumped between sets, grabbing water and air, only to surge back to life when the next band launched into their opening riff. When Bring Me The Horizon\u2019s final notes faded into the Sacramento night, it didn\u2019t feel like the end. It felt like the closing chapter of a story you\u2019ll be replaying in your head for months.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Mud, Mayhem &amp; Metal Community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\n    No festival is perfect, and Aftershock 2025 made zero attempts to hide its rough edges. Rain turned sections of Discovery Park into mud pits, lines snaked for food and merch, and every square foot of shade was contested territory. But that\u2019s the deal \u2014 you don\u2019t come to a four-day heavy music festival for comfort. You come to survive it.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n    Through the inconvenience and exhaustion, what stood out was the community. Kids in oversized band tees and noise-canceling headphones sat on parents\u2019 shoulders, seeing their first screamers and shredders. Old-school lifers in battle vests compared patches with Gen-Z hardcore kids. Strangers pulled each other off the ground in the pit, shared water, shared set recommendations, shared earplugs and inside jokes.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n    The real heart of Aftershock Festival 2025 wasn\u2019t just the lineup \u2014 it was that sense of \u201cwe\u2019re in this together.\u201d Muddy shoes, bruised ribs, sunburnt faces, blown-out voices \u2014 all badges of honor from four days spent chasing the next riff, the next song, the next moment where the outside world fell away and only the music remained.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Resurrection, Not Just Another Festival</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\n    Aftershock 2025 wasn\u2019t just another festival. It was a resurrection \u2014 of nuked-out mosh pits, of pop-punk and nu-metal nostalgia, of metal tradition, of sweaty camaraderie, and that raw, unpretty love for loud guitars and primal screams. It felt familiar but never safe, brutal but strangely hopeful, chaotic but absolutely necessary.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\n    If you found yourself drenched in sweat at the barricade, limping back to your car with ringing ears, or simply standing back and watching generations collide to the sound of distortion, you didn\u2019t just attend Aftershock 2025. You endured it. You lived it. And a piece of it is going to live in you for a long time.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Missed it? That\u2019s on you. But there\u2019s always next year. The whispers around <a href=\"https://aftershockfestival.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Aftershock 2026</a> have already started, growing louder with every replay of this year\u2019s memories. If 2025 proved anything, it\u2019s this: Sacramento\u2019s loudest weekend is nowhere near done with us \u2014 and we\u2019re definitely not done with it. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Explore additional festival coverage in the <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/reviews/\" data-type=\"category\" data-id=\"684\">Reviews</a> section at Metal Mantra.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n<p>Related: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/louder-than-life-2026-lineup-announced-iron-maiden-tool-pantera-mcr-nearly-200-bands/\">Louder Than Life 2026 Lineup Announced: Iron Maiden, TOOL, Pantera, MCR &#038; Nearly 200 Bands</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/aftershock-2026-festival-camping-cal-expo/\">Pack Your Bags, Aftershock \u2014 Camping Arrives at Cal Expo for 2026</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>More Metal Mantra: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tours/\">Metal Tours</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/\">Rundowns</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tickets:</strong> <a href=\"https://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/6786771/264167/4272?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Daftershock%20festival\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Get Aftershock 2026 tickets</a></p>\n",

Leading the announcement are two global heavyweights: <strong>Iron Maiden</strong> and <strong>Bring Me The Horizon</strong>, joined by a powerhouse roster including <strong>Papa Roach</strong>, <strong>Electric Callboy</strong>, <strong>Megadeth</strong>, <strong>The Pretty Reckless</strong>, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The festival will expand once again, running <strong>five full days from June 10\u201314, 2026</strong>, at <strong>Park 360 in Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9</strong>, reaffirming its status as one of the most ambitious and influential rock festivals in Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Iron Maiden to Headline a Special Extra Day for Their 50th Anniversary</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In a historic moment for both the festival and metal fans worldwide, <strong>Iron Maiden</strong> will headline a <strong>special added festival day on Sunday, June 14</strong>, marking an exclusive celebration of the band\u2019s <strong>50 years on stage</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This stop on their <strong>Run For Your Lives World Tour (2023\u20132026)</strong> will be among the <strong>last opportunities to see Iron Maiden live before the band takes a break from touring in 2027</strong>\u2014a major draw for longtime fans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With classics spanning decades, a stage production unlike anything else in heavy metal, and the legendary Eddie in full force, Iron Maiden\u2019s appearance is being hailed as one of the most significant bookings in Rock for People history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Festival founder <strong>Michal Thomes</strong> expressed both pride and disbelief at securing them:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cRock for People 2026 will once again be marked by the fulfillment of some of my dreams, led by Iron Maiden, whose music has shaped several generations, including me.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Bring Me The Horizon Returns as a Generation-Defining Headliner</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern heavy music juggernauts <strong>Bring Me The Horizon</strong> will headline on <strong>June 12</strong>, bringing their genre-shattering mix of metalcore, electronics, pop, and alternative rock back to the RFP stage after their unforgettable performance in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>BMTH continue to dominate globally with:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>A BRIT Award</strong></li>\n<li><strong>A Grammy nomination</strong></li>\n<li><strong>7.2 million albums sold</strong></li>\n<li>Major festival appearances including <strong>Download Festival, When We Were Young, Sick New World</strong>, and <strong>NEX FEST</strong></li>\n<li>Collaborations with <strong>Ed Sheeran, Yungblud, Machine Gun Kelly, and Sigrid</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Their high-production, emotional, apocalyptic live shows have become a hallmark of modern rock festivals worldwide\u2014and Rock for People is positioning them as the flagship act for younger audiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Rock for People 2026 \u2014 More Heavy Music Than Ever</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside the first two headliners, organizers have dropped a massive batch of <strong>22 additional artists</strong>, confirming that <strong>2026 will heavily spotlight rock, metal, and metalcore</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>First Wave Lineup Highlights</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Iron Maiden (June 14)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Bring Me The Horizon (June 12)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Papa Roach</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Electric Callboy</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Megadeth</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Breaking Benjamin</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Alter Bridge</strong></li>\n<li><strong>The Pretty Reckless</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Social Distortion</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Static-X</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Malevolence</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Blood Incantation</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Bilmuri</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Don Broco</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Lottery Winners</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Wohnout (first Czech act announced)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Yonaka</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Zero 9:36</strong></li>\n<li>And many more across the rock, metal, metalcore, punk, and alternative spectrum.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Organizers confirmed this is <strong>only the beginning</strong>, with hundreds of artists still to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Iron Maiden\u2019s Legacy Matters at Rock for People 2026</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Placing <strong>Iron Maiden</strong> at the top of Rock for People 2026 does more than celebrate an anniversary \u2014 it anchors the entire festival in heavy metal history. Very few bands can justify a standalone festival day nearly 50 years into their career, and even fewer can do it while still selling out arenas and stadiums worldwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That staying power is the result of <strong>Iron Maiden\u2019s legacy</strong>: a discography that helped define the sound, scale, and ambition of heavy metal itself. From early NWOBHM classics to global stadium dominance, Maiden\u2019s catalog continues to influence the generations of bands sharing the Rock for People stage in 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For fans looking to understand how Iron Maiden built a career capable of headlining festivals across five decades, our in-depth breakdown of <a href=\"/iron-maiden-discography-legacy/\" rel=\"internal\"><strong>Iron Maiden\u2019s discography and legacy</strong></a> explores the albums, eras, and turning points that made moments like this possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Festival Expansion, Ticket Details, and Extra-Day Options</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After a record-setting 30th anniversary edition in 2025\u2014featuring <strong>Linkin Park, Slipknot, Guns N\u2019 Roses, Sex Pistols, and Avenged Sevenfold</strong>\u2014Rock for People is once again pushing boundaries by extending to <strong>five days</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Key ticket info includes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Full festival tickets</strong> are automatically extended from 3 days to 4 (June 10\u201313).</li>\n<li><strong>Iron Maiden extra-day add-on</strong> available for <strong>CZK 1,000</strong> until <strong>October 31</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>5-day tickets</strong> also available.</li>\n<li><strong>VIP, Comfy+, and children\u2019s tickets (ages 0\u20139)</strong> are automatically valid for all 5 days.</li>\n<li><strong>One-day tickets</strong> will be available once sales reopen.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Ticket sales resume <strong>September 25 at 10:00 a.m.</strong> at <a href=\"http://rockforpeople.cz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>rockforpeople.cz</strong></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A Festival Built on Sustainability, Accessibility &amp;

    "title": "Review: Vicious Rumors \u2013 The Devil\u2019s Asylum",
    "content": "\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Vicious Rumors \u2013 <em>The Devil\u2019s Asylum</em>: No Apologies, No Soft Edges, No Exit</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s a certain point in a long-running metal band\u2019s career where the options narrow. You either lean into legacy and coast, or you dig in and remind people why your name mattered in the first place. With <em>The Devil\u2019s Asylum</em>, Vicious Rumors very clearly chose the latter\u2014and they did it without sanding down the edges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn\u2019t a \u201ccomeback\u201d record. That word gets thrown around too easily, usually when bands reappear with polite, mid-tempo material meant to offend absolutely no one. <em>The Devil\u2019s Asylum</em> is something else entirely. It\u2019s confrontational, sharp, and deliberately old-school in its values without sounding like a museum piece. This is U.S. heavy metal written by people who lived it, survived it, and still believe in it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For anyone who somehow missed the memo, <a href=\"/tag/vicious-rumors/\">Vicious Rumors</a> have been grinding since the early \u201980s, cutting their teeth in the same Bay Area ecosystem that birthed thrash royalty\u2014but always walking their own line between power metal precision and street-level aggression. Geoff Thorpe has been the constant through lineup changes, industry shifts, label collapses, and the long, slow erosion of attention spans. The fact that this band is still operating at this level isn\u2019t nostalgia. It\u2019s stubbornness. The good kind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The Devil\u2019s Asylum</em> has zero interest in chasing trends or smoothing things out for modern playlists. The riffs bite. The rhythms push forward instead of floating. Solos actually say something again. And most importantly, the album never apologizes for being metal\u2014real metal, not genre tourism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tracks like \u201cAbusement Park\u201d don\u2019t waste time pretending subtlety is the goal. It\u2019s a warped, nightmare-fuel theme wrapped in machine-gun guitars and a chorus that sticks without going soft. That balance\u2014melody without weakness\u2014is where a lot of modern bands fall apart. Vicious Rumors don\u2019t. They\u2019ve been threading that needle for decades, and here it sounds instinctive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What really carries this record, though, is its pacing. There\u2019s no bloated runtime. No obvious filler designed to pad streaming numbers. Each song earns its place, and when the album moves, it moves with purpose. You can tell this was written by musicians who still think in terms of albums, not just singles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s also impossible to ignore the context surrounding this release. The band dealt with tour delays after Thorpe suffered a serious shoulder injury\u2014exactly the kind of setback that quietly ends careers if the fire isn\u2019t there anymore. Instead of retreating, Vicious Rumors doubled down. <em>The Devil\u2019s Asylum</em> sounds like a response to that frustration: lean, pissed off, and focused. If there\u2019s exhaustion in here, it\u2019s weaponized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s be blunt for a second: a lot of veteran metal bands are still around, but very few sound hungry. This one does. And if that makes some people uncomfortable, good. Metal was never supposed to feel safe or polite. This record understands that on a fundamental level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a production standpoint, the album avoids the plastic sheen that plagues so many modern releases. It\u2019s clear, but not sterile. Heavy, but not compressed into oblivion. You can hear the air move when the drums hit. You can feel the tension in the guitar tone. That matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For longtime fans, <em>The Devil\u2019s Asylum</em> slots comfortably alongside the band\u2019s strongest modern-era releases. For newer listeners\u2014especially those who think U.S. power metal is all polished choruses and fantasy themes\u2014this album might come as a surprise. It should. Vicious Rumors have always had more grit than they get credit for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can grab <em>The Devil\u2019s Asylum</em> here:<br> <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3YKsDoK\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener sponsored\">Buy <em>The Devil\u2019s Asylum</em> on Amazon</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a scene that\u2019s increasingly obsessed with optics and algorithms, Vicious Rumors are still betting on substance. That\u2019s not fashionable. It\u2019s not easy. And it definitely won\u2019t win over everyone. But it\u2019s honest\u2014and honesty is the one thing metal can\u2019t afford to lose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The Devil\u2019s Asylum</em> doesn\u2019t ask for your attention. It takes it. If you\u2019re still here for heavy metal that values conviction over convenience, this record deserves your time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Recommended for fans of:</strong> classic U.S. heavy metal, power metal with teeth, and bands that refuse to age quietly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More album coverage like this lives in our <a href=\"/tag/metal-news/\">metal news</a> section and weekly <a href=\"/tag/new-metal-releases/\">new metal releases</a> rundowns\u2014because the scene doesn\u2019t stop just because the industry keeps changing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pick up <em>The Devil&#8217;s Asylum</em>:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Vicious+Rumors+Devils+Asylum+vinyl&#038;tag=metalmantra-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Get it on Amazon</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Related: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/metal-hard-rock-news-february-18-2026/\">Metal &#038; Hard Rock News \u2013 February 18, 2026: Thrash Reloads, Tour Season Surges, and More Lineup Shakeups</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/metal-news-january-2026-megadeth-lorna-shore-sepultura/\">Metal &#038; Hard Rock News \u2013 January 21, 2026: Megadeth\u2019s Final Salvo, Lorna Shore Storms North America, and Thrash Legends Say Goodbye</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>More Metal Mantra: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/\">Rundowns</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tours/\">Metal Tours</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More from Metal Mantra:</strong> <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/top-10-upcoming-metal-albums-2026/\">Top 10 Upcoming Metal Albums of 2026</a></p>\n",

    "content": "\n<p>This one hurts in a way that doesn\u2019t fade after the first reread. Ozzy Osbourne is dead, and the world feels quieter, duller, less dangerous because of it. The Prince of Darkness passed away on July 22, 2025, at his home in Buckinghamshire, and even writing that sentence feels wrong, like history refusing to behave. Ozzy was never supposed to be mortal. He outlived excess, addiction, scandal, broken bones, broken systems, and a music industry that tried repeatedly to sand down what made him dangerous. He survived things that would have buried lesser men before the first chorus. And yet here we are, saying goodbye to the voice that gave metal its soul, its menace, and its misfit heart. For anyone who grew up with Black Sabbath rattling cheap speakers or Ozzy solo records blasting from rusted-out cars, this isn\u2019t just the loss of a musician. It\u2019s the loss of a constant. Ozzy was always there. And now he isn\u2019t. That realization hits like a hammer to the chest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ozzy came from nothing. That matters. Birmingham steel-town nothing. A working-class kid with dyslexia, no safety net, no polish, and no future that made sense on paper. He didn\u2019t climb a ladder. He clawed his way out of the gutter by sheer force of will and an unrepeatable voice. When Black Sabbath formed at the end of the \u201960s, nobody involved knew they were inventing heavy metal. They just knew the world was ugly, loud, and violent, and the music should sound like that. Ozzy\u2019s voice wasn\u2019t pretty in the traditional sense, but it was haunting, desperate, and human. When he sang about war, madness, paranoia, and doom, it didn\u2019t feel theatrical. It felt lived-in. Sabbath didn\u2019t just create riffs; they created atmosphere. Fear. Weight. And Ozzy stood at the center of it, sounding like a siren calling lost kids home. Heavy metal didn\u2019t exist before Black Sabbath, and it certainly didn\u2019t exist without Ozzy Osbourne. That\u2019s not mythology. That\u2019s fact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being fired from Black Sabbath in 1979 should have been the end. It would\u2019ve been for almost anyone else. Addiction had its claws in him, the industry had written him off, and the narrative was already forming: tragic pioneer burns out early. Ozzy refused that ending. What followed was one of the most unlikely second acts in music history. Blizzard of Ozz didn\u2019t just prove he could survive without Sabbath; it proved he could thrive. Songs like \u201cCrazy Train,\u201d \u201cMr. Crowley,\u201d and \u201cDiary of a Madman\u201d didn\u2019t sound like nostalgia plays. They sounded hungry. Dangerous. Forward-moving. Ozzy didn\u2019t retreat into legacy status. He built a solo career that rivaled and in some ways eclipsed his original band\u2019s reach. He became the rare figure who mattered across multiple generations while still actively shaping the future of the genre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yes, the madness mattered. The bat. The doves. The chaos. The stories that became folklore. Ozzy lived the kind of rock star excess most bands cosplay but never truly inhabit. But what separated him from caricature was honesty. There was never an attempt to pretend he had it all under control. He was open about his flaws, his addictions, his failures. He wore them on his sleeve. The moral panic crowd called him evil. Parents feared him. Politicians and preachers tried to turn him into a scapegoat. Ozzy absorbed all of it and turned it into fuel. He didn\u2019t clean himself up to make others comfortable. He let the world scream while he laughed, staggered forward, and kept singing. That refusal to conform is a massive part of why metal culture exists the way it does today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then something unexpected happened. Ozzy became human to the mainstream. The Osbournes didn\u2019t soften him; it revealed him. The confused, swearing, big-hearted mess behind the eyeliner. Suddenly the Prince of Darkness was a baffled dad yelling at dogs and trying to understand remote controls. It could\u2019ve destroyed his credibility. Instead, it deepened it. Metalheads already knew Ozzy wasn\u2019t a cartoon villain. Now the rest of the world did too. He became something few metal icons ever achieve: universally beloved without ever betraying the scene that raised him. He never apologized for being metal. He just showed people who he really was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final years were hard to watch. Parkinson\u2019s. Injuries. Pain that refused to let go. Ozzy never hid it, but he also never stopped wanting to perform. Touring became impossible, and that admission cut deep. Still, he gave everything he had left. The final show in Birmingham earlier this month wasn\u2019t just a concert. It was a farewell ritual. A city paying tribute to its most famous son. Ozzy seated on a throne, visibly frail but unmistakably commanding, while tens of thousands of voices carried him through the songs that defined their lives. When \u201cMama, I\u2019m Coming Home\u201d hit, grown adults openly sobbed. When \u201cParanoid\u201d closed the night, it felt like time folding in on itself. The beginning and the end sharing the same stage. Seventeen days later, he was gone. There\u2019s something cruelly poetic about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The response to Ozzy\u2019s death tells the real story. Metal bands. Rock bands. Pop artists. Entire scenes stopping to pay respect. Tributes pouring in from artists who never sounded anything like him but were still shaped by his refusal to play it safe. That\u2019s the mark of a true pioneer. Ozzy didn\u2019t just influence metal. He changed the rules of who was allowed to exist loudly, imperfectly, and unapologetically in music. Without him, the door doesn\u2019t open for countless bands, festivals, careers, and lifetimes of noise. Without Ozzy, metal doesn\u2019t become a culture. It becomes a footnote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s the blunt truth: there will never be another Ozzy Osbourne. Not because the industry won\u2019t try, but because the conditions that created him don\u2019t exist anymore. You can\u2019t manufacture that kind of authenticity. You can\u2019t fake surviving your own mythology. Ozzy lived every lyric, every rumor, every headline, and somehow came out the other side still smiling, still grateful, still metal to his core. He wasn\u2019t perfect. He was better than perfect. He was real. And that\u2019s why this hurts so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The man is gone. The voice is silent. But the echo is eternal. Every doom riff. Every festival crowd. Every kid discovering Sabbath for the first time and realizing music can be dark, heavy, and honest all at once. That\u2019s Ozzy. Always has been. Always will be. Rest easy, Prince of Darkness. The world is darker without you, but metal will make sure you\u2019re never forgotten.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Related: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/hard-rock-news-december-5-2025/\">Metal &#038; Hard Rock News \u2013 December 5, 2025: New Songs, Farewell Events &#038; Touring Updates</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>More Metal Mantra: <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/rundown/\">Rundowns</a> | <a href=\"https://metal-mantra.com/tours/\">Metal Tours</a></p>\n",
